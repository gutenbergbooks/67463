  <h2 class='c007'>To the Reader</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Social Problems are the chief interest and study
of my life.</p>

<p class='c004'>In 1885 I published in London a work entitled
<cite>Scientific Meliorism and the Evolution of Happiness</cite>.</p>

<p class='c004'>The world of thought has acquired new knowledge
since then; and many social changes have occurred.
The present volume is not a replica of that work,
although, as before, my aim has been to gather together
the currents of meliorism pursuing diverse
courses throughout society and to throw upon these
the light of fresh knowledge gained by investigators
of economic and social science; and, above all, the
light emanating from philosophic thinkers who recognize
that the path of improved outward conditions,
and the path of inward progress for man, lie parallel
to each other. It is my belief that in this dawning
epoch of conscious evolution man may, if he so
chooses, push forward the actual life of to-day and
merge it into the ideal life of to-morrow.</p>

<p class='c004'>There has recently occurred a widespread commemoration
of the birth of that pure-souled American,
who was pre-eminently a teacher of the ideal
life. This volume, I hope, will be read in America,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>and, to the memory of Emerson I tender homage,
while adopting his phrase, “<cite>Hitch Your Wagon to a
Star</cite>,” as the motto of my book.</p>

<p class='c004'>The toil of man’s daily life alas! is indeed as the
straining and jolting of a lumbering wagon,—it
grovels, it wallows, it drags wearily, and the soul of
the wagoner soars not.</p>

<p class='c004'>But there are few thinkers who confront the great
social question of the hour as not the rescue of the
submerged tenth merely, not the elevation of the
masses only, but the uplifting of <em>all Humanity</em> to
higher levels in the scale of being.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the great process of social reform is
animated and ruled by that lofty aspiration, the
lumbering wagon of toil will become a triumphal
chariot of moral and spiritual progress.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>INITIAL CHAPTER<br /> <span class='large'>HAPPINESS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The ultimate value of all effort is the production of
happiness, and objects excite our interest in so far as we
believe them to be conducive to that great and ultimate
consummation of existence—Happiness.—<span class='sc'>J. C. Chatterji.</span></p>

<p class='c008'>The age in which we live is one of great activity
and general movement. We are passing out of
the mindless, genetic, into the rational, conscious
epochs of evolution; and while, at every stage of
human history, right conduct depends objectively
on relatively true thinking, and subjectively, on
good impulses, a transitional period such as the
present demands special efforts to attain to an
adequate and clear conception of the problems of
life.</p>

<p class='c004'>If no correct philosophy of life comes to birth
in the thinking centres of our social organism,
general conduct will continue harmful to many
and inimical to progress.</p>

<p class='c004'>How may the truth of a philosophy be tested?
No better answer, I think, can be given than that
of Buddha, of whom it is chronicled that he said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>in reference to a projected philosophy—“After
observation and analysis if it agrees with reason
and is conducive to the good and benefit of one and
all, then accept it and live up to it.” Our theory
of life must appeal to the developed reason of
civilized man and carry a conviction of its truth.
Moreover, it must be all-embracing. Sectional
aims and aspirations will never suffice. The aim
must be universal, i.e., directed to the well-being
of all mankind.</p>

<p class='c004'>In view of the question: “What is the primary
object of human life?” two significant facts are
apparent. First, the perpetual aim, conscious
or instinctive, of man, as of all physical beings,
is to compass the satisfaction of his desires, viz.,
contentment. Second, however diverse and conflicting
may seem the opinions held by popular
teachers on the subject, there is nevertheless
an essential unity. For all point to some kind
of happiness, in the present or future, for oneself, or
others, for individuals, or for the race, as the ultimate
end of existence.</p>

<p class='c004'>A close observation of actual life—apart from
theories of duty—reveals incontestably that the
instinct to seek pleasure and avoid pain is universal
and paramount. It is the general force ruling
individual conduct. A child shrinks from lessons
and seeks play because the one causes painful
effort, the other gives pleasurable sensations,
unless there are the beginnings of an intellectual
sense and the child is what we call studious; in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>that case the sense of effort is overcome by the
pleasure of learning, and there is no unwillingness.
Or when the representative faculty is strong,
the thought of a parent’s or teacher’s approval
may be so clear in the young mind as to make
the future happiness counterbalance the present
effort. But it is always pleasure at the moment,
or pleasure in anticipation, or fear of punishment,
viz., avoidance of pain, that gives the stimulus
to work. The human nature of a tender
mother is much the same. She hates to hear
her offspring cry, she loves to see them
smile. She <em>seems</em> to sacrifice herself to them, but
in reality it is not so; for her greatest pains and
pleasures reach her through them. Her personal
desires, her dearest hopes, are centred in her children.
She is proud of their acquirements, ambitious for
their future, happy in their success. When she
strives to check and discipline them, it is because
she dreads, for them and for herself, some baneful
consequences should she refrain. She does not
act for a selfish end. Her nature is more complex,
far wider and deeper than the child’s; but her
action is essentially the same. She is avoiding
painful and seeking pleasurable sensations, present
and future, for herself and her children.</p>

<p class='c004'>Nor with the poor man is the position different.
The pain of hunger or the dread of hunger, for
himself or those beings whom he loves, stimulates
to a life of continuous and wearing toil. If he
submit to present pain, it is that he may avoid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>remote pain, and secure the satisfaction of his most
pressing wants.</p>

<p class='c004'>The leisured classes are differently situated.
With conditions of life that place them above the
struggle for subsistence, they seek enjoyment according
to individual character and tastes. Whatever
interests the mind and stirs the emotions pleasurably
will be pursued. We speak of this and that career
as guided by genius, ambition, benevolence, and so
forth, but in every case these qualities of mind
have pushed choice in the direction which will
gratify the individual.</p>

<p class='c004'>If we say goodness, not happiness, is the proper
aim of life, we must allow that goodness means the
aiding to bring happiness to mankind. Religions
signifying less than this are unworthy the name
of religion. Now it is emphatically the good who
keenly suffer in the midst of an evil social state
where poverty, misery and crime abound. It
has been truly said—“The contrast between the
ideal and the actual of humanity lies as a heavy
weight upon all tender and reflective minds.”
These perceive that goodness, in their own case,
has depended largely on the conditions of their
lives, while thousands of their fellow-creatures
have had little scope for goodness, because born
and brought up in degraded, vile conditions they
had no power to escape from. It is no consolation
to the good to point to a future happy state and to
immortality for themselves. The actual is what
concerns them. Their feelings get no rest, their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>intellects surge with perpetual efforts to conceive
some means of radical reform, some method to
secure more goodness and more happiness for all,
i.e. for every woman, man and child, alive in the
present day.</p>

<p class='c004'>Turning now to published opinions concerning
the object of life, Carlyle taught that conscientious
work was the main business of civilized man.
“Be indifferent,” he cried, “alike to pleasure and
pain; care only to do work, honest, successful
work (no futilities) in this hurly-burly world.”
He directed attention from abstract ideals of the
future to the actual life of the present, pointing out
the miseries and shams of the evil social state and
powerfully inveighing against its corruptions. To
maintain an outward existence of active usefulness
and an inward state of quietism and stoicism was
Carlyle’s conception of an individual’s duty, but
while there was to be no seeking for personal reward
he believed this course would result in blessedness,
and blessedness meant something purer, nobler, more
desirable than happiness. If we take his own history
set forth in the <cite>Reminiscences</cite> as carrying out this
theory, we find that in his case it broke down. He
toiled and plodded, doing successful work to the end
of what appeared a noble, victorious career, but the
blessedness never came, or if it did, it was not nobler
and purer than happiness. It was a gloomy state,
bankrupt of hope and full of querulous, dissatisfied
egotism.</p>

<p class='c004'>George Eliot gave us no theory of life in any of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>works of genius. The action of her influence is,
however, unmistakeable. It was to develop social
and sympathetic feeling, to make individuals
tolerant and tender towards their fellows, judging
none without due regard to his or her surroundings.
She has accustomed her thoughtful readers to the
scientific aspect of human nature and social life, to
watch the manifold relations between the two, the
action and interaction of forces without and within,
and to see the continuity of causation along with
the reforming effect of ceaseless changes. The evolutional
conception of life underlies all her work.
The pictures are realistic, there is no false colouring
and vain delusions, no perfection of character—but
aspiration, effort, broad humanity—and no perfect
happiness attained. She indicated, however, that
the social state wants altering, and readjustments
there would conduce to nobler life and greater happiness.
She hoped for progress by gradual changes
in the outward social system and in inward human
nature. “What I look to,” she once said, in conversation
with a friend, “is a time when the impulse to
help our fellows shall be as immediate and irresistible
as that which I feel to grasp” (and as she spoke she
grasped the mantelpiece) “something firm if I am
falling.” Although George Eliot formulated no
theory I conceive she held the belief that happiness
for all at all times is the object of life, and to be
arrived at, chiefly, through the development of
the altruistic or sympathetic side of human
nature.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Some writers teach that culture is most to be
desired. The rapid growth of wealth in this country
has forced upwards in the social scale a class of
people destitute of culture and refinement. This
class dominates society and takes the lead in fashion.
Luxury and ostentation are everywhere prominent;
extravagant modes of living prevail without the
comfort of the former simpler and more genial
modes, and this is side by side with poverty and
destitution that do not decrease. Patronage, with
its demoralizing influence on both classes, is the most
conspicuous bond between the wealthy and the
poor, and vulgarity of mind characterizes the age.
There is little to surprise us in the fact that gentle,
refined natures withdraw from public life into
a narrow sphere, not necessarily a selfish one,
but a sphere bounded and circumscribed by their
own personal tastes and temperaments. Finding
solace in intellectual pursuits and a pure elevated
enjoyment in the study of art and literature, they
adopt the theory that culture is the proper business
of man. Sweetness and light have been held up
as the panacea for all the ills of life and the “elevation
of the masses” as the true social progress.</p>

<p class='c004'>Other teachers, thinking less of intelligence than
of moral sentiment, point to perfection of character
as the aim of life. They recognize the marked
diversity in human nature. Some intellects are
slow and dull, incapable of being kindled into fervour
or brightened into swift reflection, and culture
for such is hopeless. But in God’s sight, surely,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>all men are equal. Birds without song have brilliant
plumage to compensate the defect, and so with man.
The “law of compensation” holds throughout
humanity they have said, and, for the most part,
hearts are deep and tender even when heads are
dull. Our finest works of literature and art may
fail to give one pleasurable sensation for lack of
the special faculty to apprehend their beauty,
but kindness makes the whole world kin. When
the noble, generous, sympathetic side of human
nature is appealed to there comes a quick response.
Happiness is the aim of life, but happiness implies
excellence of character, the emotional and moral
elevation of all mankind.</p>

<p class='c004'>That Ruskin’s views were similar to the above
we learn from his <cite>Crown of Wild Olive</cite>. “Education,”
he says there, “does not mean teaching
people to know what they do not know—it means
teaching them to behave as they do not behave. It
is not teaching the youth of England the shape
of letters and the tricks of numbers, and then leaving
them to turn their arithmetic to roguery and their
literature to lust. It is, on the contrary, training
them into the perfect exercise and kingly continence
of their body and souls by kindness, by watching,
by warning, by precept and by praise—but, above
all, by example.”</p>

<p class='c004'>From the field of modern science there has come
as yet no direct teaching on the subject of life’s
duties and purpose, but two of our eminent scientists
have thrown out hints that are important and significant.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>The late Professor Huxley says of his
own career: “The objects I have had in view
are briefly these—To promote the increase of
natural knowledge and forward the application of
scientific method to all problems of life—in the conviction
that there is no alleviation for the sufferings of
mankind except veracity of thought and action
and the resolute facing of the world as it is when
the garment of make-believe by which pious hands
have hidden its uglier features is stripped off.”
(<cite>Methods and Results</cite>, Essays by Thomas M.
Huxley.)</p>

<p class='c004'>Professor Sir Oliver Lodge has stated that new
paths of investigation are opening up to science.
Telepathy, clairvoyance and some other allied psychic
states have been tested and found in the range of
actual fact. They reveal qualities in man which
although special to a few individuals only, are
latent it may be in all, and point to an unknown
province of nature to which man seems related
independently of his five senses. It becomes
evident that by the “resolute facing of the world
as it is,” science is altering our conception of man’s
existence and nature, and extending our vista of his
future.</p>

<p class='c004'>Positivist thinkers, who base their teaching on
materialistic philosophy, have bright anticipations
for the human race, although ages may elapse before
the realization of their hopes; and the existence of
poverty and misery in our midst is fully recognized,
graphically described, and feelingly deplored. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>exponents of Positivism are eloquent, cultured,
refined. We want a new religion, they say, and
without that, no rapid progress can be made. The
public mind is all at sea, floating in a chaos of unfixed
beliefs, and to reach settled convictions and
formulate a creed is the crying need of our times.
Religion is a scheme of thought and life whereby
the whole effort of individual men and societies
of men is concentrated in common and reciprocal
activity with reference to a Superior Being which men
and societies alike may serve. The Superior Being is
collective humanity, and men’s true business is to
understand and seek to perfect human nature
and the social state.</p>

<p class='c004'>A marked feature of present-day French literature,
we are told, is a reaction of religious sentiment
against the rule of scientific naturalism, and religious
sentiment dominates in the strangely pathetic
and fascinating journal of the Swiss author,
Amiel, which has been widely read. “To win true
peace,” says Amiel, “a man needs to feel himself
in the right road, i.e., in order with God and the
Universe. This faith gives strength and calm.
I have not got it. Sybarite and dreamer,” so he
addresses himself, “will you go on like this to the
end for ever, tossed backwards and forwards between
duty and happiness, incapable of choice and action?
Is not life the test of our moral force? Are not
inward waverings temptations of the soul?” To
the question—Will all religions be suppressed by
science? he replies: “All those that start from a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>false conception of nature, certainly,” and adds
reflectively: “If the scientific conception of nature
prove incapable of bringing harmony to man, what
will happen?” To which he answers: “We shall
have to build a moral city without God, without
an immortality of the soul.” Then, protesting
against Emil de Laveleyes’ notion that civilization
could not last without belief in God and a future
life, he exclaims: “A belief is not true because
it is useful; and it is truth alone—scientific, established,
proved and rational truth—which is capable
of satisfying now-a-days the awakened minds of all
classes.”</p>

<p class='c004'>I have here presented what is only a meagre
reflection of portions of our mental atmosphere,
but I know of no clearer, more definite thoughts
emanating from influential teachers calculated to
throw light on the great enigma of life. It may seem
to my readers that on these mental heights unanimity
exists as little as on the lower planes of man’s
discordant impulses, his confused and conflicting
actions. Clearly we have no philosophy of life
as groundwork to orderly personal and social action,
no religion of vital power to bind the nations in
one, no moral code adapted to the complexities
of our social relations, and, above all, no steady belief
in a universal love to sweeten society from end to
end and create the requisite medium in which
alone the nobler qualities of human nature will bud
and blossom.</p>

<p class='c004'>Nevertheless the diverse opinions held by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>above thinkers are not irreconcilable. Carlyle’s
“blessedness” is the feeling of harmony with the
divine order of development in humanity and the
universe, therefore it is identical with Amiel’s
“true peace.” The Positivists’ “Supreme Being”
is the perfected man whose endowments of sympathetic
fellowship, emotional sweetness, intellectual
light, moral strength, kingly continence of body
and soul, and knowledge of truth are specialized
and pointed to by George Eliot, Ruskin, Huxley
and others. All have simply given expression to
aspiration from the subjective side of their human
nature conformably to the evolutionary process
within themselves, and the attitude of mind produced
thereby in each. Partial, but not contradictory
views, characterise those thinkings. Beneath
superficial differences there lurks a unanimous
belief that harmony of life with conditions—viz.,
happiness, is the legitimate <em>aim</em> of life. A Humanity
steadily moving in a given direction may be infinitely
varied in detail, and since the correct philosophy
of life must be a wide generalization embracing
all, we need not wonder at its slowness to appear.
Modern nationalities are only now emerging from
the individualistic to pass into the socialistic stage
of industrial development. Our popular writers
and teachers, springing from a specialized class—not
the main body of the people—instinctively
show their limitations by individualistic or sectional
modes of thought. Mark, for instance, the insufficiency,
nay, the pathetic absurdity of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>thought—Culture will cure the ills of life, in face of
the fact that thousands in our midst to-day possess
no intellectual desires whatever, while the appetites
belonging to their physical nature which forms
the very basis of life have never been properly
met and satisfied.</p>

<p class='c004'>In setting forth a definition of happiness we have
to recognize the marvellous complexity of human
nature. We have to take into account not only
variations distinctive in, and native to, separate
individuals, but the gradations and variations
within each individual arising from progress, or the
reverse, in his or her outward condition and inward
development. Contentment means the satisfaction
of desire. But desire may be directed to the physical
plane, the emotional plane, the mental plane, the
spiritual plane. The harmony of all life is happiness,
and brings blessedness or peace.</p>

<p class='c004'>Having shown that practically infants, children,
young men and women, adults and old people of
every social class are similarly engaged in seeking
happiness, each according to his tastes and tendencies
controlled by his personal, social and spiritual
development; having shown also that thinkers
and writers offer no condemnation, I proceed to
point out that this universal habit is in harmony
with evolution. It tends to personal evolution, i.e.,
to expansion and elevation of character and capacities.
Moreover, it tells favourably on general life.
It tends to social evolution, i.e., to expansion and
elevation of the social organism or collective society
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>so long as the method pursued by each individual is
unhurtful to the other organic units incorporated
in that society.</p>

<p class='c004'>To seek to attain happiness at the expense of
other human beings whose happiness is thereby
sacrificed, is of course evil. It is anti-social, or
vicious, i.e., it is wholly adverse to personal evolution
and social evolution, in other words, to general
progress. But given a society that has carefully
surrounded its units by conditions of personal
freedom (harmonious with general well-being) in
which to seek innocent happiness, the normal man
or woman on a level with the average of his race
is not in any danger of preferring the vicious course.</p>

<p class='c004'>That we confuse a wholesome love of pleasure
with selfishness arises from the fact that individual
selfishness unhappily is developed by our
present evil system of life. Notwithstanding, it is
easy to show the real value of pleasure by its ready
alliance with unselfishness. A significant feature is
this—people take pleasure in uniting for pleasure.
Sensuous pleasures are taken as a rule, socially,
it being recognized that to civilized man the presence
of the enjoyment of others enhances his personal
enjoyment. The physiological effect of pleasure
is to promote health and activity. “Every pleasure
raises the tide of life; every pain lowers the tide
of life,” says Herbert Spencer. The pleasures of
love are essentially and pre-eminently invigorating
and social. It is only when they are selfishly
pursued that evil creeps in, and what should produce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>the purest happiness becomes degraded into a
source of misery.</p>

<p class='c004'>It seems hardly necessary to point out further
that asceticism and purism are immoral because
directed against an element in happiness. Whenever
science finds out means to alleviate suffering
or free the condition of pleasure from accidental
accompaniments that are evil, it is clearly the duty
of man to hail the discovery and apply it that he
may add to the sum of human happiness.</p>

<p class='c004'>Before touching on environment, i.e., the social
condition under which alone general happiness
becomes possible, I may classify desires into primary
and secondary in order to make the subject clearer.
Primary desires are those common to all physical
beings, the satisfaction of which (in man) is necessary
to healthful ordinary social life. Secondary desires
are those whose satisfaction is necessary to some
individuals, but not to all.</p>

<p class='c004'>Desires for food, clothing, shelter, also for work
alternating with rest, and for love, belong to the
first class. They are primary and fundamental.
But desires that imply a development of cultured
intellect, of delicate sensibilities, of high moral
and emotional attainments, of aesthetic tastes, and
of spiritual life are secondary desires, i.e., they
are not common to all at the present stage of the
evolution of man. That they may become so is
devoutly to be desired; but if we expect to reach
a high standard of life in the social organism without
first securing for its individual units the satisfaction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>of primary needs, we indulge a vain delusion.
Does a tree throw out fruitful branches before it is
rooted in the soil at its base? Development depends
on the satisfaction of primary needs, and proportionally
to these being made secure will the satisfaction
of the higher desires become necessary to
happiness.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now in relation to primary needs, the conditions
which it is the duty of society as a whole to secure
for the individual are, first: Freedom to act for
the end of securing satisfaction of desire; second,
opportunity for acquiring the means of satisfaction;
third, ability to adopt the means; fourth,
protection of life and action. And these conditions
have a wide implication. The first implies some
control of individual conduct as regards propagation,
that each social unit may possess a sound
constitution and the comfort of physical health.
The second implies access to nature. The third
implies education to give knowledge and skill. The
fourth implies an organized society with an appropriate,
scientifically arranged system of industry.</p>

<p class='c004'>That our present confused industrial and social
system—the survival of an archaic state—is inimical
to happiness, few thinkers will deny. Discontent
is not confined to the poor. Where wealth abounds
there is little, if any, real happiness. “The towers
of Westminster,” says Edward Carpenter, “stand
up by the river, and within, the supposed rulers
contend and argue.... The long lines of princely
mansions stretch through Belgravia and Kensington;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>lines of carriages crowd the park; there are clubs
and literary cliques and entertainments, but of the
voice of human joy there is scarcely a note....
And I saw the many menacing, evil faces, creeping,
insincere worm-faces, faces with noses ever on the
trail, hunting blankly and always for gain; faces
of stolid conceit, of puckered propriety, of slobbering
vanity, of damned assurance.</p>

<p class='c004'>“O faces, whither, whither are you going?</p>

<p class='c004'>“No God, no truth, no justice, and under it
all no love.</p>

<p class='c004'>“O the deep, deep hunger!</p>

<p class='c004'>“The mean life all around, the wolfish eyes, the
mere struggle for existence, as of man starving on
a raft at sea—no room for anything more.</p>

<p class='c004'>“O the deep, deep hunger of love.”</p>

<p class='c004'>This picture of the degradation and misery of
rich and poor alike is essentially true to fact. Our
collective life does not supply the necessary conditions
for real happiness in any section of the community;
and nothing less than a reconstruction of
society and regeneration of its life will suffice to
meet the wants of humanity. Immense efforts are
put forth in philanthropy and benevolence. Enormous
energy is expended in partial or sectional
reforms; for quite correctly has it been said that
“Reform tends to run on a single rail, the majority
of people refusing to study society as an organism
of organisms resting on biological law.” (John
M. Robertson.) We make no attempt as yet, to
prevent waste of energy, to focus the factors of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>meliorism, to mass them, to direct them straight
to the causes of evil and apply them effectively there—and
that, because we have no carefully constructed
scheme of thought and life whereby the
whole effort of individual men and societies of men
is concentrated in common and reciprocal activity
to the end of creating happiness for all.</p>

<p class='c004'>Social regeneration is necessarily of a two-fold
character, embracing action without and action
within. The first—which I call objective, signifies
collective action on the physical plane adapted to
promote and sustain the healthful, happy vitality
of a race expected to grow steadily and uniformly
in physical, mental, moral and spiritual elevation.
The second, which I call subjective, signifies collective
action directed to the repression of all the
unsocial desires of man—those selfish emotions and
narrow affections that alloy the mental and moral
structure of human beings and render it impossible
to develop the spiritual side of Humanity. The
Darwinian laws—supposed by many to be still
applicable to man—had relation, not to happiness,
but to the preservation of life and the continuance
of the race in the genetic, unconscious period of
evolution. It is in the conscious period or stage
of evolution that happiness evolves. Our present
system of social life, if system it can be called, is
a chaos of conflicting interests, duties, thoughts,
feelings, actions—a prison-house in which the finer
qualities and attributes of man can scarcely exist.</p>

<p class='c004'>Let us put forth all our strength to create out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>of this chaos “the garden in which we may walk.”
Let us break down the walls of our prison-house
till it “opens at length on the sunlit world and the

<p class='c008'>The only safety of nations lies in removing the unearned
increments of income from the possessing classes and adding
them to the wage-income of the working classes or to the
public income in order that they may be spent in raising
the standard of consumption.—J. A. <span class='sc'>Hobson</span>, <cite>Contemporary

</div>

<p class='c014'>It is a leading thought in modern philosophy that in its
process of development, each institution tends to cancel
itself. The special function is born out of social necessities;
its progress is determined by attractions or repulsions
which arise in society, producing a certain effect which
tends to negate the original function.—<span class='sc'>William Clarke.</span></p>

<p class='c008'>If we view the physical aspects of existence in
relation to happiness, it is obvious that the satisfaction
of desires for food, clothing and shelter
stands first in order of urgency in the life of nations.</p>

<p class='c004'>That modern nationalities are very far from the
attainment of this satisfaction of primary wants
is lamentably evident to the eye of observers who
examine the conditions in which the great majority
of their members live. Food to the mass of the
people is excessively dear. In order to buy it for
his family, a workman has often to spend two-thirds
of his weekly wage, leaving one-third only
to meet the cost of shelter and clothing, and nothing
at all for recreation and instruction.</p>

<p class='c004'>If we add to this difficulty of satisfying the primary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>needs of a family on average wages, the frequent
lack of employment with the consequent lack of
any weekly income at all, and the prevalence of
low wages, rightly termed starvation-wages, we
have before us a picture of the utter inadequacy
of our present industrial system to subserve general
well-being.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is necessary to understand something of our
present industrial system, its foundations and
evolution in the past, if we are to forecast the changes
that will occur in the immediate future, when the
fast-growing recognition of its manifold failings
must inevitably bring about a different order of
industry. Private property in land and in other
essentials for the production of food, shelter, clothing,
etc., lies at the basis of the present system;
and since the direct object of private proprietors
is not to satisfy the primary needs of the people,
but to create individual profits, we cannot wonder
that a system thus motived by selfishness works
out in a miserable and wholly imperfect manner.</p>

<p class='c004'>The industrial class may be broadly divided into
two sections, employers and employed, while a few
highly skilled workers, members of the professions
of law, medicine, arts, letters, and science stand
in a measure outside this category. Landlords and
shareholders as such are an idle section of the community.
They absorb the labour of a multitude
of workers, while giving no personal service in return.
Quite truly has it been said: “The modern form of
private property is simply a legal claim to take year
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>by year a share of the produce of the national
industry without working for it.” (<cite>Fabian Essays</cite>,
page 26).</p>

<p class='c004'>In comparing past forms with the present forms
of industry, a distinguishing feature of the latter
is the number of great factories where workers toil
long hours, usually in the tending of machines, to
turn out for the private profit of their employers,
vast quantities of goods destined for retail distribution
all over the world. The large organizations
of industry, so familiar to us, are of quite recent
growth, and already show signs of a coming change
as sweeping in its scope as any changes that have
occurred in the past. Yet to listen to the expression
of opinions that prevail in literary and upper class
circles, one would suppose we had reached finality
in our social system, and that the conventional
tributes paid to proprietors of land and capital in
the shape of rent and interest would, as a matter
of course, remain legal to the end of time.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now let us glance at the history of the past.
For two centuries after the Norman conquest,
intestine war and feudal oppressions embittered
the life of the British labourer. He might be called
from the plough at any moment to take up arms in
his master’s quarrel, and if he sowed seed and saw
his fields ripen, the harvest of his hopes might still
be cut down by the sword of the forager, or trodden
by the hoof of the war-horse. He was bondsman
and slave, defenceless in the hands of the lords of
the soil, who at best, protected him only in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>barest necessities of a scanty livelihood—a hut
without a chimney, its furniture a great brass pot
and a bed valued at a few shillings. (Wade’s
<cite>History of the Working Classes</cite>.) A change for
the better came after the plague of 1348, and,
when by perpetual warfare with France, men
had become more valuable through diminution of
their number.</p>

<p class='c004'>King Edward the Third freed the bondsmen to
recruit his armies, and enforced villeinry service
was exchanged for service paid by wages—these,
however, were ordinarily fixed by statute. In the
middle of the eighteenth century wages stood at
the ratio of about a bushel and a half of wheat for
one week’s labour; by the middle of the nineteenth
century they had fallen to what could only purchase
one bushel of wheat. (<cite>Threading my Way</cite>, R. D.
Owen, p. 220.) The cause of this change was that
meanwhile, two clever men—Arkwright and Watt—had
made discoveries which gave an impetus to
industry beyond all previous experience. Mechanical
aids to production were invented, and the consequent
cheapening of products created more and
more demand. Machinery and human labour side
by side were under stress and strain to meet the
call of new desires. Cotton and wool and flax were
woven into fabrics and poured out of Great Britain
to every quarter of the globe; capital was amassed,
and wealthy capitalists bid against each other
for more labour still. Agriculturists flocked into
towns, factories sprang up in all directions, population
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>rapidly increased, and children were sucked
into the industrial maelstrom, for health and happiness
were in no way considered when remunerative
work was offered.</p>

<p class='c004'>Outwardly the British world had altered. Internal
warfare had passed away, and the war-horse was
no longer visible in harvest-fields. The scene now
presents a resemblance to a huge hive of bees
industriously secreting and amassing honey for future
use. Great Britain has assumed beyond her own
shores a foremost place among civilized nations.
The resources of her newly-created wealth seem
boundless, and everywhere her power is felt. She
can thin the ranks of her population, and swell her
army to conquer and suppress the tyrant Napoleon,
while keeping at work the enormous leviathan of
her own trade and commerce by the deft fingers of
her little children. Summer and winter find her
tiny bees—infants of seven or eight—at labour in
the factories from six a.m. to noon. One hour for
dinner is allowed, and they toil on once more till
eight o’clock at night.</p>

<p class='c004'>Were these, then, the “good old times” of which
we are proud? At all events they <em>were</em> the times
in which England’s greatness was established and
vast fortunes were built up, founded upon the
industry of young children sweating in factories
for thirteen hours a day.</p>

<p class='c004'>“It was not in exceptional cases,” wrote Robert
Dale Owen, when on a tour of inspection of factories
with his father in 1815, “but as a rule, that we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>found children of ten years old worked regularly
fourteen hours a day, with but half an hour’s
interval for the midday meal, eaten in the factory.”
In the fine yarn cotton mills, the “temperature
usually exceeded 75 degrees,” and in all factories
the atmosphere was more or less injurious to the
lungs. In some cases “greed of gain had impelled
mill-owners to still greater extremes of inhumanity,
utterly disgraceful to a civilized nation.” Their
mills were run fifteen, sometimes sixteen, hours a
day, and children were employed even under the
age of eight. “In some large factories, from one-fourth
to one-fifth of the children were cripples or
otherwise deformed. Most of the overseers openly
carried stout leather thongs, and frequently we
saw even the youngest children severely beaten.”
(<cite>Threading my Way</cite>, p. 102.) At that period
Robert Owen the elder expressed himself thus to
the Earl of Liverpool: “It would be clearly unjust
to blame manufacturers for practices with which
they have been familiar from childhood, or to
suppose that they have less humanity than any
other class of men.” The system was what Robert
Owen condemned, and he strained every nerve to
bring about some alterations in the system. He
wrote and spoke and agitated for the protection
of children by law, and for their compulsory education,
and he publicly exposed the ghastly evils
that spring from competition unchecked by law,
while left free to regulate itself at any amount of
cost to life, health, and happiness.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>After the lapse of about four years, the first point
aimed at by Robert Owen was gained, and infants
became protected by statute from gross oppression.
His second point was gained in 1870, when the
Government Bill for National Education was
passed. And ever since the period of that noble,
unselfish life, minds have everywhere been awakening
to the truth of his third point, viz., that frightful
evils inalienably belong to free industrial competition.</p>

<p class='c004'>Owen proved that in the year 1816, the machine-saved
labour in producing English fabrics—cotton,
woollen, flax, and silk—exceeded the work which
two hundred million of operatives could have turned
out previous to the year 1760. (<cite>Threading my
Way</cite>, p. 218.) The world was richer then to the
extent of all this enormous producing power—a
power, he thought, surely sent down from Heaven
to set man free from the ancient curse that in the
sweat of his brow should he eat bread. But what
were the actual facts? There was no respite from
toil for the workers, no freedom from the curse!
Throughout the old and new world, senseless
machinery competed with the living sons of toil,
or, as Robert Owen expressed it, “a contest goes
on between wood and iron on the one hand, human
thews and sinews on the other—a dreadful contest,
at which humanity shudders, and reason turns
astonished away.” (<cite>Threading my Way</cite>, p. 218.)
The problem presented was this: A recent rapid
growth of wealth had enriched the few and left many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>in misery; nay more, it had lowered and pressed
down the many to depths of degradation previously
unknown. Were there no means by which mankind
could <em>unitedly</em> work for the benefit of all, and
all be made happy as the world grew richer?
Political Economy suggested none, and Robert Owen
turned from its futile study to that of the facts
themselves. He was a manufacturer, in sympathy
with employers as well as with employed. He had
every opportunity for a practical understanding of
the interests involved, and he gave years to the
study of this question in a spirit of keen inquiry
and ardent devotion to the cause. His ultimate
conclusion was that in <em>some form of socialism alone</em>
could a remedy for the existent evils of industrial
life be found.</p>

<p class='c004'>Henceforth he laboured to give to the world an
object lesson in socialism. He embarked his fortune
in bold experiments, which proved—as in the
case of New Harmony—financial failures. Into
the details of these failures I cannot now enter, nor
have we to deal just yet with socialism as a remedy.
My present purpose is to show the origin and
reality of the evils inherent in the individualistic
system of industry—evils on which the argument
for socialism is based. And I must reiterate the
statement made by John Stuart Mill in 1869, that
the fundamental questions relating to property,
and to the best methods of production and distribution—questions
involved in socialism—require
to be thoroughly investigated. Mr. Mill’s opinion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>regarding socialism was that in some future time
communistic production might prove well-adapted
to the wants and the nature of man, but a high
standard of moral and intellectual education would
first be necessary, and the passage to that state
could only be slow.</p>

<p class='c004'>Meanwhile the sufferings of the proletariat are
as intense as in the days of Robert Owen. The
problem which absorbed his energies and wrecked
his fortunes remains as yet unsolved, and we, who
live when a twentieth century has been entered
upon, are daily surrounded by a mass of workers
tied hand and foot by poverty and often weighed
down by despair. And this is the case, notwithstanding
the lapse of a long intermediate period of
national prosperity; in spite, also, of the powers of
science to enlighten manual labour, the intellectual
efforts to advance education, and a boundless
benevolence and sympathy ready to embrace all
mankind, and give happiness to all, were only the
right means devised wherewith to accomplish that
end.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c004'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. In the <cite>Scotsman</cite> of March 16, 1897, this paragraph
occurs: “At the meeting of Edinburgh Parish Council
yesterday, it was stated that pauperism is increasing, and
pointed out that for the month ending 15th ult. there was
an increase of 114 applications for individuals for relief,
compared with the corresponding period last year!”</p>

<p class='c004'>It was stated by Mr. Rowntree (whose investigations of
this subject are widely known and respected) that one-fourth
of the population of Great Britain lives in poverty,
either primary or secondary; while 52 per cent. of the cases
of primary poverty are due to the principal wage-earner
receiving too low a wage to maintain his family in physical
efficiency. (<cite>Evening News</cite> Report, March 22, 1903.)</p>
</div>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>Individual benevolence has failed, and that as
completely as Robert Owen’s socialism, to cope
with general poverty, and the method of Poor Laws
has accomplished almost nothing.</p>

<p class='c004'>In Robert Owen’s day the evils described in factory
life belonged specially to Great Britain. That
is not the limit, however, now. I need only refer
my reader to Henry George’s picture of poverty
dogging the footsteps of progress in America and to
Professor Goldwin Smith’s corroborative words:
“It is a melancholy fact, that everywhere in
America we are looking forward to the necessity of
a public provision for the poor.” And again:
“There will in time be an educated proletariat
of a very miserable and perhaps dangerous kind,
for nothing can be more wretched and explosive
than destitution with the social humiliation
which attends it, in men whose sensibilities
have been quickened and whose ambition has
been aroused.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The problem respecting appalling poverty in the
midst of wealth (it is a poverty marring the happiness
of the rich as well as the poor) cries out for
solution. It forces itself upon public attention in
the old world as in the new. There is no escape
from it. The problem must be grappled with by
educated reason, and solved by means of the patient
exercise of a cold calculation of natural forces.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Happily it is recognized in its evolutional aspects
by many thinkers all over the world. Twenty years
ago Charles Letourneau in his <cite>Sociology</cite> wrote:
“In every country which enjoys the European
system of civilization, the right of property has ever
been in a state of evolution, always tending to give
a greater degree of independence to the individual
owner; in other words, the evolution is always
worked in favour of individual egotism. Who can
say that the evolution is now complete, or that we
have yet realized the highest ideal system in the
disposition of our property? A progressive evolution
is, for every society, one of the conditions of
existence. The right of proprietorship cannot,
therefore, remain stationary.” The period that
has elapsed since that passage was written has
witnessed a widespread and strong growth of opinion
upon these lines.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the <cite>Contemporary Review</cite> of February, 1902,
Mr. J. A. Hobson thus writes: “... The idea of
natural individual rights as the basis of democracy
disappears. A clear grasp of society as an economic
organism completely explodes the notion of property
as an inherent individual right, for it shows
that no individual can make or appropriate anything
of value without the direct continuous assistance
of society.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The right of proprietorship in land is the first
principle to examine. The relation between land
and life in its simpler aspects is clear and definite.
All classes of land animals—man included—are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>immediately dependent for subsistence upon the
produce of land, and when man emerges from
slavery, another element, namely, labour, enters
into the conditions of his life and becomes, with
land, essential to his existence. Of food, fitted for
the nourishment of man, uncultivated land produces
little save some wild fruits and edible roots,
and many wild animals, which he may eat if in
hunting them down they do not eat him. But
land placed under the additional forces of man’s
physical and intellectual energies produces an immense
variety of objects—a perfect wealth of raw
material, vegetable, animal, mineral—which, yielding
to further elaboration through his efforts and
genius, all help to create for him a civilized life.
This raw material, in short, supplied man with food,
shelter, clothing, with the comforts and luxuries
his developing nature demands, and with all necessaries
to the existence of literature, science, and art.</p>

<p class='c004'>Passing over the primitive forms of associated
life—the nomad and pastoral—we come to the
agricultural stage, when labourers on the land are
manifestly the all-important social units. They
sow, till, and reap the fields. They tend domestic
animals, whose skins and wool are made into garments
by other members of the group. But the
latter depend for food and the raw materials of
their industry on the cultivators, who are, if I may
so express it, the foundation stones of the simple
social structure. To whom does the land belong?
To the whole group, and an annual division amongst
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>the families for purposes of cultivation takes place,
whilst weapons, fishing-boats, tools and other
movables are the property of individuals.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now observe, a change gradually occurs, a change
from the communal possession of land to a system
of the individual possession of land, and force is the
sole cause of this change. External aggression has
initiated militant activity, while, in the process of
frequent resistance to invasion, and frequent aggression
upon others, there is produced the class inequalities
which distinguish a militant type of
society and a system allowing of individual land-ownership.
Land becomes private property in
the hands of the bold and crafty, who compel the
cultivation of the soil by the landless men of the
group, and by prisoners of war spared on condition
that they perform hard labour. The institution of
slavery thus becomes established, and it is a leading
factor in the promotion of civilization. Lords of
the soil spend their energies in warlike activities,
whilst protecting their slaves and serfs at labour.
The produce of that labour is appropriated by the
dominant class, and used for its own particular
benefit. Its requirements extend much beyond
the mere necessaries of existence that it yields to
the workers, and slowly there uprises a new form of
labour and a large class of labourers, producing a
variety of commodities to gratify the desires of
pomp-loving, barbaric chiefs.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now this class, the labour of which is wholly
absorbed by the chiefs, must be fed from the produce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>of the land. How is this accomplished? The
chiefs, while exacting hard labour from the slaves
and serfs, yield them only a bare living. But the
proceeds of their labour, over and above the bare
living of the producers, is very considerable. There
is therefore a large surplus, which, appropriated
by the chiefs as rent, is the source of their power.
With it they support a large class of landless men
engaged in ministering to their own specific wants.
Moreover, this class groups itself around the castle
of the chiefs, which are filled with military retainers,
and here we have the beginnings of towns.</p>

<p class='c004'>The town population increases steadily with the
increase of the surplus produce from land under
better conditions of cultivation. Markets and
stores are instituted, and a commercial system is
introduced. Barter gives way to the use of money,
and the entire social organism expands and becomes
more complex.</p>

<p class='c004'>Anon, slavery disappears. But workers on the
land—always the most necessary social units—remain
poor as before. Competitors for work, in
danger of starving, drive no hard bargain with
masters who are in full possession of the soil, and
able to forbid their growing even the simple fruits
and grain required for a meagre living. For food
enough to live, they readily pledge the labour of
their whole lives, and since nature’s recompense
for labour is liberal, there is an abundant surplus
produce for landowners to grasp and employ as
they choose. Into the towns it is sent, and there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>it stimulates progress—mental and material—and
creates new departures in social life.</p>

<p class='c004'>Class inequalities among town workers increase,
and labour becomes organized. The mentally
stronger dominate the weaker in the new fields of
industry. They direct and control the production
of commodities for the use of the dominant class,
and succeed in acquiring a greater reward for their
work than a meagre living. Out of the surplus
produce of the land they become able to secure
from their lords a portion which forms the foundation
of wealth in a new social class—a class of landless
capitalists who, possessing brain power and
later money-power, become the supreme factors in
altering social conditions. These men promote
manufacture and commerce by action similar to
the landholders’ methods of promoting agriculture.
They press down their workers to a bare living, and
take as profits all that competition permits of the
results of the joint labour. These profits they
apply to the satisfaction of their personal desires
and the carrying out of their schemes of manufacturing
and commercial enterprise. Finally, they
indulge in luxurious living and emulate landholders
in the purchase of valuable commodities, thus
stimulating certain trades.</p>

<p class='c004'>Meanwhile, through the intercourse of urban
life, mental activity rapidly augments. Education
is initiated, aptitude and skill are more and more
prized and rewarded. Invention profoundly modifies
the primitive modes of production, and genius
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>aspires to understand and govern the forces of
nature. One direction taken by mental activity
eventuates in an important social force, viz., the
Church, or religious organization. Many of the
best minds in early ages were allied with the priesthood,
and the Church’s desire for stately temples,
gorgeous shrines, and decorative worship have
enormously aided the outward development of
architecture, sculpture, painting, and music, and
the inward growth of aesthetic capacity. But
priests and all whose labour is absorbed by the requirements
of religious worship and the constructing
of temples, must be fed on the produce of the
land. The priesthood is maintained in leisure
by rents, tithes, or the voluntary offerings of the
people. It is freed from the necessity of industrial
labour and military activity, and members within
this large class have devoted their leisure to literature,
history, philosophy, and art, thereby greatly
advancing civilization.</p>

<p class='c004'>Under increased stability of governments the
organization becomes of a mainly industrial type.
Nations now possess enormous wealth in the form
of material commodities, wealth in the form of
intellectual literature and the educational institutions
that promote knowledge; wealth in the form
of ornament—all that embellishes and makes
beautiful the surroundings of human life; and all
this wealth has come into existence through the
natural action of evolutionary forces—an action
creative, step by step, of a system of social interdependence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>and regulation. The prominent features
of the system are: First, private property in land;
second, great social inequality; third, poverty of
manual labourers; fourth, a large town population,
and a small or minimum peasant population. Its
less prominent but no less decisive feature is the
complete social subjugation of the poor by the rich.</p>

<p class='c004'>The supports of the system through the whole
process of its growth have been labourers on the
land, and these labourers have scarcely at all partaken
of the national wealth. The food they reaped
formed the motor force vitalizing and energizing
the evolving social organism. Food was the ruling
power deciding the growth and extent of economic
life, as well as the form of its development. But
food-producers have never determined the destination
of the surplus food, and in this fact lies the key
to a great social problem which students of social
science are bound to comprehend. The landholders—and
these as a rule have not been workers on the
land—have decided the destination of the surplus
produce. Up to the present-day landlords—including
the proprietors of coal, iron and other mines,
capitalist employers of labour, the churches of the
nation, and hereditary rulers—are at the fountainhead
of modern civilization. It is through their
action—caused mainly by selfishness, tyranny,
pride, greed—that cultivators and operatives have
been kept at maximum toil and been limited in
number, while at the same time the land’s resources
have developed and improved until land and labour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>united serve to support an enormous mass of population—individuals
of entirely distinctive character,
activities, social position and social worth, all alike
in this one particular—they are daily and hourly
consumers of the produce of the land.</p>

<p class='c004'>A good harvest that is general over the world
sends activity like an electric current through the
economic system. A bad harvest, if universal,
would cause universal depression; not agriculture
alone must suffer, but manufacture, commerce,
science, art, literature, education, recreation—for
on the production of food depends the buying
power of the whole trading world. It is true that
modern countries are not maintained from their
own food resources alone. Also, it is true that the
machinery of exchange—money and our vast credit
system—enter into the phenomena and confuse
the student’s mind. Nevertheless, an all-important
fact discloses itself on close investigation, viz.,
this—the relation of landlordism to modern civilization
is not accidental, it is essential and causal.</p>

<p class='c004'>As already shown, the general drift of the produce
of the land has been into the towns; and thither
also have migrated the labourers. Machinery and
science applied to land cultivation lowered the
amount of peasant labour required, but it did not
lower the birth-rate. Surplus peasants have been
driven by necessity from their homes to the centres
of manufacturing industry, and, competing for
work there with the operative class, have kept
wages low and facilitated the enriching of capitalist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>employers. These men, actuated by personal desires,
selfish ambition, and a tendency to mercantile
speculation, use their wealth in extending the production
of objects that minister to a life of luxury
and refinement.</p>

<p class='c004'>The older political economists mistakenly taught
that “all capital, with a trifling exception, was
originally the result of saving.” (J. S. Mill’s <cite>Political
Economy</cite>, book 1, chap. 5.) Attention to the history
of social evolution, however, proves the fact
to be otherwise. Not individual saving, but social
seizure, created capital. Its origin, as we have
shown, was the surplus produce taken from producers
and disposed of by a dominant class. It
originated through the selfish quality of rapacity
and not through the respectable virtue of prudence,
as some capitalists would have us believe. The
growth of capital has been enormous since the
beginning of the industrial revolution; and at the
present moment the riches of a comparatively
small number of the owners of our land and capital
are colossal and increasing. At the same time,
there is no diminution of poverty among workers.
Thirty per cent. of the five million inhabitants of
London are inadequately supplied with the bare
necessaries of life, and about a fourth of the entire
community become paupers at sixty-five. I refer
my reader to Sidney Webb’s pamphlet, <cite>The Difficulties
of Individualism</cite>.</p>

<p class='c004'>The supersession of the small by the great
industry has given the main fruits of invention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>and the new power over nature to a small proprietary
class, upon whom the mass of the people
are dependent for leave to earn their living. The
rent and interest claimed by that class absorbs, on
an average, one-third of the product of labour.
The remaining 8<em>d.</em> of the 1<em>s.</em> is then shared between
the various classes co-operating in the production,
but in such a way that at least 4<em>d.</em> goes to a set of
educated workers numbering less than one-fifth of
the whole, leaving four-fifths to divide less than
4<em>d.</em> out of the 1<em>s.</em> between them. “The consequence
is the social condition we see around us.”
(Ibid.)</p>

<p class='c004'>Thus four out of five of the whole population—the
weekly wage-earners—toil perpetually for less
than a third of the aggregate product of labour, at
an annual wage averaging at most £40 per adult,
and are hurried into early graves by the severity of
their lives, dying, as regards at least one-third of
them, destitute, or actually in receipt of poor law
relief.</p>

<p class='c004'>In town and country, the operatives and peasants,
who, united, form one large class engaged in manual
labour, resemble Sinbad the Sailor, on whose
shoulders rides the Old Man of the Sea. It is they
who maintain our leisured classes. The proletariat
carries on its back all the rich and their innumerable
dependents, more than 300,000 soldiers, an immense
navy, a million of paupers, a number of State pensioners,
a multitude of criminals, His Majesty and
the Royal Family, all Government officials and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>ecclesiastics—a vast host of unproductive consumers
throughout society.</p>

<p class='c004'>Slavery of the many for the comfort and enjoyment
of the few! That is all man has attained to,
so far, in the evolution of society. And no one
who studies the facts of life can deny this impeachment
of civilization: “All over the world the
beauty, glory, and grace of civilization rests on
human lives crushed into misery and distortion.”
(Henry George.)</p>

<p class='c004'>The extremity of contrast between rich and poor
has no ethical justification. Under purely ethical
conditions, every child born into a nation should
have equal chances of life, comforts, and luxuries,
with every other child. But, as we know, one
British babe may be born to an income of £100,000
a year, and another to no income, but to a constant
struggle for bare subsistence and a pauper’s grave
at last. The system permitting this is <em>ethically
odious</em>. Nevertheless, we have to recognize that,
under non-ethical conditions, development has
taken place, and we must accept the process as the
natural, inevitable result of all prior conditions.</p>

<p class='c004'>Man’s ethical nature itself is the product of a
slow evolution, not yet so advanced as to require
and create purely ethical social conditions. Changes
in the future will proceed on lines of natural growth,
as in the past, but with this supreme difference—the
issues will be favourable to general happiness,
the advance infinitely more rapid, because aided
by conscious human effort.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>All schemes of social reform that are revolutionary
are widely chimerical to the thoughtful evolutionist,
for were we suddenly to deprive our richer classes
of property, privilege, and power, we should simply
create a general abasement of our national civilization.
Our upper classes, rendered effeminate by
ill-spent leisure and all the artificial pleasures of a
voluptuous and inane life, are incapable of directing
civilization to the highest and noblest ends. Yet
it is out of their midst that springs the demand
for commodities ministering to all the amenities
and refinements of a civilized life. It is refinement
alone that demands refinement, culture that demands
culture; and were the control of human
labour to pass <em>suddenly</em> from the hands of the upper
into those of the lower classes, which are still, in
the mass, degraded and unenlightened, there would
be no effective demand for these commodities, and
the science and art implicated in their production
would inevitably, though gradually, disappear.</p>

<p class='c004'>Progressive evolution culminates in social justice,
and the principle of private property in land, which
implies an injurious monopoly in what is essential
to human life (and is therefore socially unjust), is
certain to be consciously relinquished at a given
stage of the nation’s intellectual and moral advance.</p>

<p class='c004'>Having traced the evolution of the individualistic
system of industry, and seen that the inherent
evils of the system have their source in the private
ownership of land and capital, which “necessarily
involves the complete exclusion of the mere worker,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>as such, from most of the economic advantages of
the soil on which he is born, and the buildings,
machinery, and railways he finds around him”
(Sidney Webb), let me now sum up and state the
paramount evils that have to be overcome. For
the workers these are—low wages, long hours of
toil, difficulty of obtaining work, and, when it is
obtained, uncertainty of being permitted to retain
it. For the community generally there are further
evils, viz., first, the mal-production of commodities
made manifest in food adulteration and in a perpetual
output of objects that, instead of promoting
and conserving civilization, debase and corrupt
public taste and morals; and, second, the mal-production
of human life, for poverty is a social
force that directly tends to racial degeneration. A
population born and bred in our city slums becomes
physically, mentally, and morally unfit.</p>

<p class='c004'>The facts of poverty and the unemployed are
impossible to deny. Frederick Harrison’s picture
is accurate; ninety per cent. of the actual producers
of wealth have no home they can call their own
beyond the end of the week, have no bit of soil or
so much as a room that belongs to them, have
nothing of any kind except so much of old furniture
as will go in a cart; have the precarious chance of
weekly wages, which barely suffice to keep them in
health; are separated by so narrow a margin from
destitution that a month of bad trade, sickness or
unexpected loss brings them face to face with hunger
and pauperism. This is the normal state of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>average workman in town or country. (<cite>Report of
Ind. Ref. Congress</cite>, 1886.)</p>

<p class='c004'>As regards the children of these workmen, fifty
per cent. die before they reach five years of age,
while eighteen per cent. only of upper class children
die at the same age. The industrial evolution of
the last 150 years, with its labour-saving machinery
and highly organized masses of wage-workers, has
done nothing at all to lessen poverty. Poverty
has steadily kept pace with the increase of population.</p>

<p class='c004'>But observe in the present day there is one significant
feature that forces itself upon public attention—a
feature revealing to the social student our
approach to that stage of evolution spoken of by
William Clarke in the passage I quote as motto to
this chapter: “Each institution tends to cancel
itself.... Its special function and progress produce
effects tending to negate the original function.”</p>

<p class='c004'>If we look minutely into the latest developments
of large businesses, we find that the diminution in
the number of competitors does not as a rule lead
to an easing of the competitive struggle. As Mr.
J. A. Hobson observes and demonstrates: “It is
precisely in those trades which are most highly
organized, provided with the most advanced
machinery, and composed of the largest units of
capital, that the fiercest and most unscrupulous
competition has shown itself.” (<cite>Evolution of Capital</cite>,
p. 120.) There is an increase, in short, of the
elements destined to destroy competition. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>anxiety, arduousness, and wastefulness of strife
among the rival competitors, becomes so intolerable
that a mutual truce and amalgamation is sought
after as a release. When fully realized, the amalgamation
becomes a monopoly, and competition, that
much vaunted check to counteract the natural
rapacity of private capitalists, ceases altogether.
Let industrial monopoly be fairly established, and
behold! competition, with all its merits, real or
assumed, is abrogated.</p>

<p class='c004'>But industrial monopoly <em>in private hands</em> becomes
intolerable to the public, so that invariably, in the
long run, the community either puts a forcible stop
to the monopoly, or assumes it, and administers it
as a State function.</p>

<p class='c004'>We may confidently assert that as large industries
approach to the stage of absorption into monopolies
of federated groups of wealthy capitalists, the more
general and widespread grows dissatisfaction and
resentment on the part of the dispossessed smaller
capitalists who have been beaten out of the field.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now, the trend of movement to-day, through
the whole fields of production and distribution, is
from business on a small scale to business on a large
scale, and the formation of limited companies,
rings, trusts, etc. By purchasing raw material in
greater quantities an immense saving is effected,
and the same occurs in the advertising of goods and
in organizing numerous workers instead of a few.
These savings make it possible to lower the price
of the finished commodity to the public. Hence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>the change from smaller to larger commercial
enterprises is favourable to public interests up to a
certain point. But the moment monopoly point
is reached, the position straightway becomes reversed.
Henceforward the public have no protection
from a sudden raising of prices, for, the competitive
check having been withdrawn, monopolists
dominate their respective fields of production and
distribution, and the individually selfish forces
alone hold sway.</p>

<p class='c004'>This tendency, then, to larger and larger industrial
organization, with its wasteful warfare and other
attendant evils, implies a certain advance. It
indicates competition working out to its last expression
and final breakdown. It points to the supersession
of the individualistic industrial system by
a collectivist industrial system requiring democratic
state-ownership of land and the means of
production and distribution of all commodities.</p>

<p class='c004'>In process of civilizing man has made himself
acquainted with many laws of nature, and has
learnt so to handle matter as to direct its forces into
channels carrying benefit to himself. He has thus
become the controller of natural forces in as far as
they lie within reach of his mental comprehension
and physical activities. It is by this method, and no
other, that our advance along the line of material
civilization has been accomplished, and all further
extension of the comforts and amenities of economic
and social life is certain to be obtained through
persistence in this available and satisfactory course.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>Now, throughout the domain of non-material
civilization, man has never constituted himself
controller of natural forces, although, in orders of
life inferior to his own, he has guided many vital
forces. For instance, there are vegetable and
animal forces—all subject to natural law—that he
has enlisted in his service and made submissive to
his dominion. The forms of vegetable life around
us to-day—cereals, fruit-trees, plants, and flowers
of infinitely varied tint—bear witness to the art
and skill of man; and the animal kingdom, ruled
by mysterious biological laws, has provided him
with faithful servants obedient to his will, in a life
which to dogs and horses is largely artificial.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the order of his own social life man’s position
is wholly different. What we behold, if we take an
objective view of a so-called civilized society, is a
marvellous variety of complicated movements.
These are the outcome of forces pursuing an unbridled
course; and that course is always the path
of least resistance. As yet there is no intervening
force of a collective, mental nature to adapt that
course to an ultimate definite aim and purpose, or
to harmonize broadly those lines of least resistance
with the line of permanent and universal advantage
to mankind. As Professor Lester F. Ward expresses
it, “Man has made the winds, the waters, fire, steam
and electricity do his bidding. All nature, both
animate and inanimate, has been reduced to his
service.... One class of natural forces still remains
the play of chance, and from it, instead of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>aid, he is constantly receiving the most serious
checks. This field is that of society itself, these
unreclaimed forces are the social forces of whose
nature man seems to possess no knowledge, whose
very existence he persistently ignores, and which
he consequently is powerless to control.” (<cite>Dynamic
Sociology</cite>, vol. I. p. 35.) These unreclaimed social
forces—selfishness, rapacity, pride—give activity
to the competitive system, and run riot on the basis
of private property in land and the means of production.
But the present condition of things
cannot much longer persist, and a new industrial
system, the outcome of far more elevated social
forces, is shaping itself rapidly in many minds
throughout Europe, America, and the whole civilized
world; that system of co-operative industry we
have now to consider.</p>

  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER II<br /> <span class='large'>ORGANIZED INDUSTRY</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The true organic formula of political as of economic
justice is—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“From each according to his powers,</div>

      <div class='line in28'><span class='sc'>J. A. Hobson.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Whilst bearing in mind that the present economic
system—a system unconsciously produced through
the play of selfish forces—was a necessary stage
of evolution, and tended to progress so long as
savage proclivities in the mass of the people made
a closer social union impossible, we have also to
recognize the changes, outward and inward, occurring
under that system. First, a rise of co-operation,
both voluntary and involuntary—in factories and
throughout business generally—has taken place,
causing evolution to proceed on wider lines. Second,
a slow, silent, unstudied, half-unconscious movement
has advanced, and in these days eventuated
in the conception of a new system which purports
to be the form that industrial evolution must
assume in the near future. And inasmuch as this
new system is less egoistic and more social than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>any system of competition, it will move on ethical
lines of progress.</p>

<p class='c004'>The present system, as we have seen, is based
on private property in land and the instruments
of production and distribution. In opposition
to this, socialism implies that the State or people
collectively should own the land and instruments
of production and distribution. Further, that
the State should organize routine labour and direct
the distribution of produce upon this basis, and
that throughout society social equality should
be established and maintained.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sentiment of justice and the feelings of
sympathy and solidarity, without which no socialized
society could exist, are prominent everywhere
to-day. They manifest in philanthropic action
all over the country, in constant efforts to adjust
political and economic forces to lines of social
equality and in the revolt of wage-workers, throughout
the civilized world, from conditions they are
finding intolerable and will not much longer endure.</p>

<p class='c004'>A wholly unselfish order of life is impossible
still, but under any intelligent collectivist system,
individual selfishness becomes modified and controlled.
Hence we may confidently expect that
the strong anti-social feelings fostered by the private
property and competitive system of industry will
largely subside in the greater fraternity of an
organized socialism.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is significant that ignorant opponents, in
their wildly erroneous interpretation of the theory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>of socialism as an equal division of money to all,
recognize the gross injustice of the present distribution
of wealth. The wrong and misery accruing
from the individualistic system of industry are
widely felt and freely admitted, while the underlying
causes of the evil and the true remedies are
not yet understood.</p>

<p class='c004'>As regards the connexion of socialism with the
theories of political economy, I must shortly explain:
Political economy is the science of wealth—its
production and distribution. But as the science
relates exclusively to the present competitive
system, the socialist finds in it a full exposure of
the evils involved in that system, and ample grounds
for striving to bring about its supersession by a
system of co-operation on a socialized property
basis. There is not and there cannot be any conflict
between a true political economy and a scientific
socialism. The one describes what is, the other
what may be and ought to be. Both recognize
that wealth is produced (and it is the only possible
way) by the application of labour to land, and its
products. In the present system, the individual
possession of land and the instruments of production
forms the ruling factor, producing inequality
in the distribution of wealth and gives
the basis on which commercial competition rests.
In referring to laws of political economy, it is
not unusual to speak as if they were laws of nature,
no more to be banished than the law of gravitation.
On this assumption there is raised the argument
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>that society is forever bound to the present system,
with its payments of rent, interest and profits out
of the surplus proceeds of labour. Nevertheless,
it is easy to see that the so-called laws of economics
are only rules of social living springing from motives
of human self-seeking exercised within the generally
accepted conditions of private property in the
essentials of life. It is not necessary for the socialist
to contend against any single generalization of
political economy; each may be true on its own
basis, but, <em>with that basis</em> socialism is at war. Let
society relinquish the property basis, and political
economy remains applicable only to the past, while
in the future the motives of human self-seeking
enter upon a fresh career in a more altruistic system.</p>

<p class='c004'>We must grasp the true nature of the various
tributes imposed upon labour—rent, interest,
profits and rent of ability—to comprehend their
economic bearing. A farm is the private property
of a landlord, while it is cultivated by a farmer
and his labourers. The proceeds of the industry
of the two latter is divided into three portions—the
labourers’ wages, the landlord’s rent and the
farmer’s profits. The first, dependent on demand
and supply in the labour market, is kept down to
what will cover the expense of a bare subsistence;
and the second is always the highest amount the
landlord can extract above the portion the farmer
consents to live upon after paying the subsistence
wage to his labourers. A landlord’s rapacity,
however, is no longer the only factor in determining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>rent, since State interference has been found
necessary for protection of farmers in the public
interests. The economic bearing of rent is this:
it gives effect to the demands of the landlord class
for the results of an immense amount of labour
applied to the production of varied commodities.
As already explained, the produce sold in towns
by farmers to pay rent goes, in large measure, to
the support of workers who are manufacturing
luxuries, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">objets de luxe</span></i>, and many meretricious
wares that minister to the depraved taste of men
and women whose happiness is destroyed by a life
of idleness and ennui.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is not land only, but capital in the shape of
railways, factories, workshops, machinery, etc.,
that are held as private property. For the use
of these, therefore, workers pay a tribute called
interest on capital. This interest gives effective
demand to the wants of a large class of comparatively
idle shareholders, who further absorb the
services and produce of another great army of
workers. The next tribute, namely profits, is a
claim connected with the organizing of labour. It
represents a prodigious tax levied upon workers,
a tax that enables employers and managers—more
or less wealthy—to enjoy comforts and luxuries
their employés can never command. The fourth
tribute has been called the rent of ability. It
rests on the non-ethical principle that some people
deserve from society a great reward for work they
have pleasure in doing, while the toilers engaged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>in irksome, dangerous, dirty, distasteful work—however
necessary to the whole community—are
only entitled to a pittance wage.</p>

<p class='c004'>Let us look at the proportional value of rent,
interest, profits and rent of ability in their relation
to the reward of manual labour. Out of the yearly
income of the nation, recently computed at
£1,450,000,000, £510,000,000 goes in rent and
interest and £410,000,000 in profits and salaries
to the ruling classes, while £530,000,000 only is
available for payment of wages to manual workers.
But when we consider that the latter compose
the great mass of the population, and the former
a small section or fraction of it only, the enormities
involved in the working of our property
institutions exhibit their true colours, and the
growing sense of justice within civilized humanity
revolts wholly from the system. The facts,
roughly speaking, are that one-third of the total
income of the nation goes to four-fifths of the
population, while the remaining one-fifth pockets
two-thirds of the income. (See Sidney Webb in
<cite>Fabian Tract No. 69</cite>.)</p>

<p class='c004'>In the Census of 1891 there were 543,038 adult
men who entered themselves as not working for
a living. We may assume these belonged chiefly
to the wealthy classes, and if we reckon their
average incomes at £500 per annum, there emerges
a sum of £271,519,000 as approximately the value
of the labour they exact each year from workers
to whom they render no services in return. Again,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>if we add to the number of these idle men the women
and children now living on rent and interest, the
above computation falls far short of the reality.
And, need it be said, the more there is taken from
workers by non-workers, the less must remain for
the workers themselves.</p>

<p class='c004'>To people ignorant of economic principles, the
man who spends a good income on personal gratifications
appears—in his relations to society—either
passive, or active beneficially, inasmuch
as he “gives employment,” and his “giving”
on these lines is lavish. Moreover, it is considered
that the difference between rich and poor is one
of <em>natural</em> inequality, of which, if workers complain,
they are considered as unreasonable as the
invalid who complains that other people are healthy.
But the facts admit of no such analogy. The rich
owe everything to the poor. They are simply
a parasitic class, and the money they spend represents
a power (socially permitted) to command
and absorb the labour of their fellows. They
exact life-long services, for which they bestow no
personal service in return. Were we to place a
rich man with all his money on an uninhabited
island, however fertile, he would at once be reduced
to his natural stature. No money would cause
his daily comforts to spring up around him, and
still less the many luxuries without which he feels
his existence has no charm. In order to live he
himself must work, for he is the sole representative
of the scores of fellow-men on whose labour he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>has hitherto wholly depended for necessaries and
all the amenities of a civilized life. The absorption
by one of the labour of many is a social arrangement
of genetic origin, and is immoral or non-ethical
in character.</p>

<p class='c004'>Socialism is the philosophy of a pure, wholesome,
progressive industrial life, to be initiated and
maintained by human effort—nay more, it is a
veritable Gospel of Peace. And I use the word
Gospel advisedly, for the finest religious quality
of human nature is not in those beings who calmly
pursue a course of spiritual development for themselves,
unmindful that the physical part of their
fellows craves the food and rest without which
the latent soul within cannot manifest itself.</p>

<p class='c004'>We have seen that in the domain of feeling the
stirrings of socialism have for years been agitating
the bosom of society, and although the outcome
in philanthropic action issues usually in failure,
none the less does it spring from the highest and
holiest motives of man. But while philanthropy
chiefly represents love’s labour lost, there are other
and more virile forces in action that are indicative
of a coming organic democracy. Observe, for
instance, the constant efforts of the people to
alter the political and economic strain by State
interference. This agitation is a very significant
fact. It betrays a hunger for social justice which
will certainly increase with the growth of knowledge,
public spirit and sensitiveness to personal
rights. This hunger can never be fully appeased
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>under any system that permits wealth to flow to
the lucky, the clever, the cunning, the greedy,
and be handed down by inheritance and bequest
from generation to generation. No modification
of individualism and not even socialism will banish
all popular agitation. Communism is the far-distant
goal to which it points, for communism
alone sets forth as attainable a satisfying equality
in all the comforts of life, and since evolution
must eventuate in social justice, whatever falls
short of this will inevitably contain some conditions
of discontent.</p>

<p class='c004'>But whilst a craving for justice among the masses
cries out for State interference, from whence comes
the modern view of what justice means? Among
the classes it has been considered that the man
who is clever, i.e. mentally strong, has a right to
a greater reward for labour than the man who is
stupid. The origin of this notion is simply the
fact that in a competitive system he is able to
obtain that superior reward. Power, and not any
ethical idea, is the foundation of the notion. The
notions of justice prevailing throughout society
have all arisen naturally in the past amid the
strong and privileged few, and readily have they
been accepted by the docile and oppressed many.
The clever, not the stupid, have formed public
opinion, and that under a purely egoistic impulse.
Nevertheless, as evolution passes from the unconscious
to the self-conscious stage, reason unites
with altruistic feeling to give birth to new conceptions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>that are moulding public opinion to a
higher and truer form, and working out on the
plane of practical action. The conception of
justice involved in socialism is naturally unpalatable
to the privileged few, but it goes far to prove
the truth of socialism, that the conception is the
fruit of the most advanced study of our social
organism <em>as a whole</em>, while it coincides precisely
with the blindly instinctive pulsations of the central
mass of the people.</p>

<p class='c004'>Turning now from the moral and emotional to
the economic and practical side of the question,
we are bound to inquire by what methods transition
from the present competitive commercial system
of industry to the socialism of the future will take
effect. For, be it observed, supporters of the
latter system not only assert its ethical superiority,
but further assert that it is both practicable and
economically inevitable.</p>

<p class='c004'>There are two, and only two, general directions
of popular reform: first, the revolutionary—the
driving straight at established institutions with
the intention of overthrowing them; second, the
legislative—the aiming to improve the existing
system by co-operative methods and the modification
and gradual destruction of its worst features,
i.e. its extremes of injustice and inequality. I
have to point out how retrograde and futile for the
promotion of happiness is sudden revolution.
It is the spontaneous method of human passion
where intellect is unenlightened on natural evolution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>and causation. It seeks to overturn what, for the
time being, is the highest product of evolution,
and it would blindly substitute that, which although
ethically superior, the society of the time is unable
to support. The method of legislative reform,
national and municipal, is the rational one; and
no other, we may confidently hope, will be tried
in the civilized countries of Europe so long as
socialists are not harassed and persecuted for
their opinion beyond the point of endurance.</p>

<p class='c004'>Already, as regards legislation in this country,
the power of the Demos—the mass of the people—is
acutely felt. Step by step our rulers have been
compelled to lower the political franchise in order
to quell revolutionary tendency and maintain
their position. Fear-forces within the social organism
have changed direction unnoted at the
surface. The classes are secretly more afraid of
the people than the people are of the classes; yet
the actual burdens borne by the people are in no
way lightened. And why is this so? Because
the people generally are ignorant of their political
power, and still more ignorant of how to wield it
favourably to their own interests. As has truly
been said: “The difficulty in England is not to
secure more political power for the people, but
to persuade them to make any sensible use of the
power they already have.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But social forces of persuasion and enlightenment
are ready prepared for their guidance. In
the upper and lower sections of the middle class,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>men and women whose culture is scientific and
whose moral sentiment is advanced, are ranging
themselves in the van of the world’s progress,
and chiefly through their efforts there is pouring
into and penetrating the darkness of the masses
a flood of intellectual enlightenment. This process
begun has its definite bearings. A growing intelligence
in the people will cause the displacement
of all authority that is irresponsible. A
better selection of legislators will be made, and
these, constrained by judicious criticism, will
study the principles of social science and learn
how best to attain the clear ends of government.</p>

<p class='c004'>As our masses rise to the full exercise of their
political power and the democratic trend of the
nation goes forward, no higher motive force than
that of self-seeking is required to secure better
social conditions. Not only does the ignorant
self-seeking of the masses carry weight commanding
attention, but the intelligent self-seeking of rulers
is a force set in similar direction. To please the
majority of constituents is their highest policy;
and since food and leisure and education are the
essential needs of that majority, such available
intellect as the legislative body possesses will be
honestly applied to promoting the increase and
better distribution of these various necessaries
of a civilized life; in short, to promoting the
general well-being in so far as the exigencies of
the times permit.</p>

<p class='c004'>I do not deny that self-seeking in rulers has hitherto
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>mainly led to the clever hoodwinking of ignorant
constituents. I merely assert that we have rounded
the point of Cape Danger in that regard. Every
step we take on democratic lines, every advance
we make in educating the people, removes us
further from that danger point. Moreover, I
assert that extending the Parliamentary franchise
to women of every social class will equally work
for good. The new altruistic or philanthropic
spirit of the age has laid firm hold of the so-called
educated women of to-day. When public responsibility
presses these women to self-education
in politics, the myriad injustices revealed will
cause them to turn from futile individualist charities
and concentrate their energies on works of real
and lasting social reform. We may confidently
anticipate that the British Parliament will become
an excellent instrument of Democratic Government
when certain reforms—that are already widely
agitated—have been carried out. These reforms
are that: “The House of Commons should be
freed from the veto of the House of Lords, and
should be thrown open to candidates from all
classes by a system of payment of representatives
and a more rational method of election.” (See
<cite>Fabian Tract No. 70</cite>.)</p>

<p class='c004'>There are two lines of action certain to be pursued
by a Parliament growing yearly more democratic.
One is the line of protection of labour, the other
is that of an active service of the people. Now
State interference with trade—in the interests of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>workers—is condemned by the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laissez-faire</span></i> school
of economists. Such action is scoffingly termed
“grandmotherly legislation.” It is deprecated as
injurious to society as a whole, as an outrage on
the liberty of the British subject, and an impious
desecration of the capitalistic fetish, “Freedom
of Contract.” But when the knowledge of facts
proves that on one side this so-called freedom
signifies freedom of choice between dire starvation
and the distasteful terms of an absolute master,
surprise is not felt that intelligent men prefer what
the ignorant may regard as a species of State bondage.
This preference is a feature of the times
clearly visible. No doubt, where social equality
reigns, individual liberty is a noble attainment;
but with inequality in the means of life and the
fundamental conditions of social happiness, a
State that is honestly striving to restore the balance
is a very <em>fount of justice</em>. The quest of the workers
is not that of individual liberty, but of a collective
liberty, embracing every man, woman and child
within the ranks of their own order.</p>

<p class='c004'>There is no moral principle that condemns State
interference, although we may admit that occasionally
it has wrought evil instead of good. Failures
have been caused by ignorance alike in the rulers
and the ruled. But as knowledge of the real
problem advances, errors in governing will become
less frequent, and the action of the State be marked
by a wise adaptation to human needs in view of
the greatest happiness possible.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>State regulation is simply a matter of power
and expediency. At the present low stage of
civilization, for just so long as the ruling power
is exercised by a propertied minority, it will prove
injurious to the majority; but when the power
passes over to the people the evils from which
the majority suffer—in so far as they are remediable
by society—will be slowly and surely redressed.
Our County, District and Parish Councils are important
instalments of democracy. These elected
bodies, with their increasing powers, are potent
to make of the community an ever larger and
larger employer of labour, until, at the will of the
people, all industries become absorbed, and the
collectivist system of labour organization is gradually
established. It is evident that the instruments
of a thoroughly democratic administration
are rapidly perfecting in Great Britain; and when
the ideal of socialism dominates the national mind,
these will present a ready means of realizing the
ideal in practice. Ignorance of the ideal leads
many minds into the false assumption that the
raising of wages, and to do this the impoverishing
of capitalists, is the socialistic <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sine quâ non</span></i> in
State action. But as Mrs. Bosanquet explains:
“In our nineteenth century cry for higher wages
we are apt to lose sight of the fact that many things
are more important to the working-man than a
few shillings added to his weekly income. A good
supply of water, well-paved and lighted streets,
a market in which he can always obtain wholesome
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>food, and properly guarded sanitary conditions,
will do more to raise his standard of living above
that of his ancestors than any increase of mere
money income. With those he can lead a healthy,
orderly life on comparatively small wages; without
them no rise in wages, however desirable in itself,
will enable him to escape danger and disease.”
(<cite>Rich and Poor</cite>, by Mrs. Bernard Bosanquet.)</p>

<p class='c004'>This puts the case for municipal socialism in
a nutshell. No amount of philanthropy, no
amount of individual action is likely to provide
a parish with a good water supply, properly paved
and lighted streets, sanitary dwellings and a well-managed
market. (<cite>Fabian News.</cite>) Yet these are
fundamental requisites of general well-being, and
another requisite for well-being and progress,
dependent upon State action, is education of the
people. If the power of the masses and their
independence of arbitrary authority grow out of
accord with their real knowledge of things, disastrous
and bloody revolutions become possible.
That in some sort the State must educate the
masses is a principle already acknowledged and
acted upon. We know, too, with how little success!
But as Government loses its evil characteristics
and grows enlightened, our State education will
be directed to new ends. Its aim will be to impress
such knowledge on the rising generations as will
prepare them for social life, and instruct them in
the means of averting misery and increasing happiness.
It will educate them in the science of society
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>and true meliorism, in the best methods for repressing
anti-social feelings, in the formation of
noble ideals of conduct, and in that religion which
unites mankind in the region of the heart and
makes of their union a living and growing social
organism.</p>

<p class='c004'>But while this is the aim of State education,
the exact means adopted may vary. Where
parents are superior much may be left in their
hands, but inferior parents can never be permitted
to train up children in inferior ways at the risk
of lowering social purity and health.</p>

<p class='c004'>I believe the time will arrive when Government,
acting on its right of force and expediency, will
take up and sequestrate the small class of social
units who, defective by nature and evil conditions,
are unable to control the injurious tendency to
propagate their kind. This degraded minority
will be kindly dealt with and allowed all liberty
not inconsistent with the careful guarding of public
safety. The object to attain would be simply the
putting an end to their evil stock.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the matter of State education, as well as in
that of State interference with trade, objections
are made on the ground of injustice. “Why,”
it is asked, “should a man without children be
taxed to educate the children of others? Is it
not unjust that the earnings of the prudent should
be taken to save the imprudent from the consequences
of their own folly?” My answer is that
besides being expedient, it is not socially unjust
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>and the argument rests on the fact that the rewards
of life depend upon the economic conditions of
society much more than upon individual effort
or merit. The amount of a man’s income is determined
by forces not created by justice, and over
which he has no personal control. A clever
physician may command the fee of a guinea a visit.
Let another competent man appear in the neighbourhood
and charge half a guinea, the first has
to lower his fee or lose his patients, and if he lowers
his fee, the sum of the incomes of the two physicians
sharing the patients between them will be less
than the amount of the single income originally
derived from that source. A man’s gains are what
the competitive system ordained by society permits
him to seize, whether he be working hard or not
at all. Within these non-moral conditions an
appeal to justice is irrelevant. Outside the non-moral
conditions, what justice requires is that all
men should be socially equal in respect of two
things, viz. liberty and the ordinary comforts of
life.</p>

<p class='c004'>If employers do not deem it unjust to lower
wages, neither should they deem it unjust were
the State to lower their incomes to the precise
amount their employés receive. Society has in
the past arbitrarily arranged conditions that favour
the few; why should it not now arbitrarily rearrange
these conditions favourably to the many?
If we take the average amount of all incomes to
represent the sum each worker might justly receive,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>we find that a number of people have far more
than this sum. The surplus represents then an
“unearned increment” obtained by force of circumstance.
A still larger number of people, on
the other hand, are wholly unable to win, by any
effort they may make, the above average amount,
even if they work hard and well all their lives. Is
it not just and reasonable that the more fortunate
are required to give up a portion of their “unearned
increment” in order that in the interests of society
the children of the less fortunate should be
educated? And, again, the improvident and immoral
are nature’s defective children. Does not
the highest religion demand that they should be
tenderly dealt with and spared—if that be possible—all
the tortures that nature unaided would bring
upon them.</p>

<p class='c004'>I believe that, under conscious evolution, the
State will become in its action more and more
philanthropic, simply for this reason—its members
will become more and more humane and public-spirited.</p>

<p class='c004'>Voluntary and State agency, however, will continue
to co-exist. Each has its peculiar merits
and demerits, and each individual case to be dealt
with has its peculiar conditions. Science and
experience must in each case therefore decide
which agency applies best. There is no foregone
conclusion that under State Socialism all private
industries will collapse. The principle of the
system is that no method of industry, hurtful to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>society as a whole, may exist, and the power of
the State shall be rigorously used to protect the
interests of the whole, as against conflicting individual
interests. Even now it is felt, through
the growing democratic spirit, that for our public
bodies to take advantage of the struggle for employment
of starving, hard-pressed men and
women, is a national disgrace. It will soon be a
point of honour with the nation to fix a minimum
wage for public employés much above the competitive
rate. Some County Councils have already
been moved to direct that workers employed by
them, or under their contracts, should be paid
trade-union wages. Parliament has in some cases
acted similarly, and when we remember that Government
at this moment is the largest employer of
labour in the kingdom, we realize that its example
in giving wages determined more by equity than
by competition will have a raising effect upon
wages in private employment.</p>

<p class='c004'>There is not any danger, however, that the
movement of taking over the industries of the
country by the State will stop short of the most
favourable point. As I write this chapter, the
following paragraph has appeared in a socialist
journal of to-day: “It is proposed to establish
a gigantic trust to control the entire iron-producing
interests of the United States. This, of course,
is eminently proper from an economic view, as
it is a clearly demonstrated fact that production
on a large scale is cheaper than production on a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>small scale. Carnegie, Rockefeller and Morgan,
proposers of the iron trust, are, from a certain
standpoint, benefactors of the race, inasmuch as
they will demonstrate the practicability of the
co-operative idea on a national scale in production.
In due time the people will recognize the folly of
allowing these men to reap the whole profits, and
the system will be readjusted.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Another important public event was the introduction
into the British Parliament of an Employer’s
Liability Bill. “This Bill proceeds,” said
its introducer, “on the principle that when a
person for his own profit sets in motion agencies
which create risks for others, he ought to be civilly
responsible.” (<cite>The Scotsman</cite> Report, May 4, 1897.)
Now it goes without saying that the iron trust, and
all trusts and commercial rings and monopolies,
create the risk of a disastrous rise of prices to the
general public, and a consequent greater inequality
of wealth possession than even that from which
we are suffering acutely to-day. A logical executive,
holding the above principle, will inevitably
annex to the State these huge outgrowths of the
competitive system, will keep down prices to the
level required by the general interests, and apply
profits to the good of all.</p>

<p class='c004'>That the time is not far distant when nationalization
of the land will take place, appears from the
fact that many others besides socialists advocate
the measure. But we must not suppose that rent
will be abrogated. The State will impose a charge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>on the fertile and well situated lands to create
conditions that are fair not only to consumers
but to cultivators, whose labour in view of a given
result must vary according to the superiority or
inferiority of soils and situations. District Councils
will in all probability organize agricultural labour,
the State only drawing a rent; while to present
owners of the land compensation will be made,
and, if accustomed to work on the land, salaried
positions in the new order offered.</p>

<p class='c004'>The rent exacted by the State may become the
single form of taxation necessary for purposes of
administration and for organized labour engaged
on such service of the people as does not bring in
any profit. But when routine industries bearing
on universal needs belong to the State, profits will
flow into the national exchequer. It will be possible
to gradually increase the State’s payment for
labour as the workers become more capable of
elevating their standard of life and consuming
wisely; while the surplus profits will be available
for the organizing of new services to be rendered
free.</p>

<p class='c004'>The carriage and distribution of letters is a comparatively
long established State industry. The
carriage of human beings should equally become
so. The State’s taking over of railways and the
municipalities’ taking over of tramways cannot
be much longer delayed.</p>

<p class='c004'>Bread baking and distributing by Government
employés is pre-eminently desirable, to put an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>end to adulteration in a primary necessary of life
and to prevent the waste of energy which takes
place in the present disorganized system. Already
there is such a general complaint of the quality
of bakers’ bread, that an approved method of
baking from pure flour under State control would
be welcomed by all who perceive how the racial
blood is more or less poisoned and its vitality
lowered by what is called “the staff of life.”
(A prolonged process of baking breaks up the
starch granules, and renders bread more digestible.
The extra expense and trouble precludes the
adoption of this method by private bakers.)</p>

<p class='c004'>Again, the health of the nation suffers cruelly
from poison germs carried in the medium of milk.
But when district councils have organized agricultural
labour, dairy produce will be distributed
under strict Government control. Emulation will
spring up among local authorities all over the
country to excel one another in the arts of rapidly
acquiring and skilfully managing all industries
that affect general health, and thus raising the tide
of life within the bounds of their jurisdiction.
With this aim broadly accomplished, the minor
industries might safely be left for some time in
private hands and under a competition modified
in a greater degree than now by State inspection
for the benefit of workers and consumers.</p>

<p class='c004'>Among services to be made free to the public,
those of transit bulk largely and should probably
come first—free railway and steamship service,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>free tramway and cable-car service, to be followed
in time by a more or less complete service of
free entertainments calculated to develop art and
promote a happy, joyous life.</p>

<p class='c004'>If we cast our thoughts forward and try to realize
the action and interaction of these altered social
conditions upon society, we can hardly mistake
the nature of the changes humanity itself will
undergo. With the destruction of the frightful
incubus of poverty, human hearts will no longer
be wrung by anguish, bitterness, despair. With
opportunity freely afforded for regular employment
and its ample reward, for decent and wholesome
living, and a civic life brightened by many pure
pleasures, the degrading and false excitements
will cease to allure. Drunkenness, vice, crime
will greatly diminish. Instead of the desperate
struggle for bread and all that appertains to an
animal life pure and simple, a new struggle will
arise—a benign, inspiring emulation to attain to
and acquire the noble qualities of humanity, the
distinctive characteristics of, not the lower animal,
but the higher spiritual man.</p>

<p class='c004'>Respecting the form of government in a Socialistic
State, I cannot do better than quote Mr. J. A.
Hobson: “A developed organic democracy will
have evolved a specialized ‘head,’ an expert official
class, which shall draft laws upon information
that comes to them from innumerable sources
through class and local representation, and shall
administer the government, subject to protests
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>similarly conveyed.” “The conditions of a really
effective expert officialism are two: such real
equality of educational opportunities as shall
draw competent officials from the whole people;
and such a growth of public intelligence and conscience
as shall establish the real final control of
government for society in its full organic structure.”

  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER I<br /> <span class='large'>THE LAW OF POPULATION</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The population question is the real riddle of the Sphinx,
to which no political Oedipus has as yet found the answer.
In view of the ravages of the terrible monster over-multiplication
all other riddles sink into insignificance.—<span class='sc'>Huxley.</span></p>

<p class='c008'>No human life can be maintained without food,
and no healthy individual life can be maintained
without good food in sufficient quantity; therefore,
the relation of numbers to the actual food supply—in
other words, the Population Question—stands
at the threshold of our social inquiries and at the
base of all social reform.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the beginning of last century, Malthus, who
knew nothing of evolution, expounded the doctrine
that man tends to increase more rapidly than the
means of subsistence; that population and food,
like two runners of unequal swiftness chained together,
advance side by side, but the pace or natural
rate of increase of the former is so immensely
superior to that of the latter that it is necessarily
greatly checked. And the checks are of two kinds.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>They are either positive—that is, deaths occur from
famine, accident, war or disease, and keep down
the population so that the means of subsistence
are just sufficient to enable the poorer classes barely
to exist; or they are preventive—that is, fewer
births take place than man is capable of causing.</p>

<p class='c004'>This doctrine was a fertile germ of thought in the
mind of Charles Darwin. He, while conscious to
some extent of the process of evolution, was grappling
with the great problems of differentiation and
genesis of species. How came it that the life which
is assumed to develop from low and simple to the
highest and most complex forms everywhere exhibited
breaks, or sudden changes, in the apparently
natural order? Darwin perceived that a key to the
enigma lay in the marvellous fecundity of organisms.
Each group reproduced its kind in overflowing
numbers, and accidental conditions destroyed individuals
and groups that failed to secure sufficient
food or to protect themselves from enemies. Here
were factors of progress, but factors by no means
admirable—a murderous slaughter of the weak, a
frantic struggle for existence, culminating in violent
death or slow starvation, ultimately in extinction.
Nevertheless, the medal had two sides, for the race
is to the swift, the battle to the strong; bread is
the portion of the wise, favour the reward of skill.
Should we feel surprise that in a semi-theological
and metaphysical era, rather than a scientific one,
Darwin formulated his great discovery in terms
suggesting not a cruel, but a beneficent Nature?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>His law of natural selection, or survival of the fittest,
established itself in many minds as a sacred principle
that man could neither deny nor seek to counteract.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now this conception, carried into the field of
economics, confused the minds of men engaged in
the study of facts and problems of human life and
progress. Political economists had to contemplate
a social strife and struggle for existence among men
as fierce and relentless as that holding sway in the
brute kingdom. And in this struggle society as a
whole stood on the side of external nature as opposed
to the mass of striving individuals. A genetic,
spontaneously developed system of industry favoured
a high birth-rate that kept wages low, an unscrupulous
exploitation of labour in the interests of capital,
a wholesale slaughter of infants, a crushing out or
trampling down of the weak, and a perpetual grinding
of the face of the poor, while, simultaneously,
wealth was multiplying and capital becoming concentrated
and easy of control by the so-called
princes of industry. Conditions of life to the great
mass of the people were fraught with constant
misery; yet, since Darwin had demonstrated—in
his <cite>Origin of Species</cite>, published in 1858—that a
struggle for existence eventuates in the survival of
the fittest, enlightened thinkers, with a few rare
exceptions, accepted the cruel facts of industrial
life without any conscious moral revolt from the
system.</p>

<p class='c004'>“<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Laissez-faire</span></i>” was the logical outcome of
Darwinian law applied to human affairs, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>Darwin’s authority dominated the public mind of
the period. Christianity was teaching the principle
that the poor would be with us always; a poet
cheerfully sang “God’s in His Heaven; All’s right
with the world; All’s love and all’s law,” and
political economists expounded the laws of demand
and supply, of rent, of wages, of profits, of interest,
etc., without one hint or surmise that man himself
was bound to interfere with the action of derivative
laws, to modify or even annul them.</p>

<p class='c004'>Meanwhile an instinct of sympathy, rudimentary
in primitive man, was steadily growing and strengthening
during all the transitions of tribal, village-communal,
feudal and national life, in the stormy
militant epoch, till the moment arrived when it
compelled man’s interference. Spontaneously,
impulsively, individual philanthropy interposed
between a suffering humanity on the one hand, and
on the other external nature and a social system that
were alike relentless. It supported the weak and
helped the unfit to survive. It deliberately selected
the half-starved, the diseased, the criminals, and
enabled them to exist and propagate. Finally it
forced society to make laws subversive of the policy
of “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laissez-faire</span></i>,” thereby introducing a new order
of things, irrespective of all doctrinaire principles
or authoritative teaching. That new order of
things is socialism, and the genesis of socialism is
distinctly to be traced to the vital element in human
nature—unselfish sympathy.</p>

<p class='c004'>The rise and progress of philanthropic action
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>carries momentous issues in various directions, both
unfavourable and favourable to human welfare.
It has made the law of natural selection and survival
of the fittest obsolete for us as applied to man.
It tends to a lowering of the level of average health
and a gradual <em>degenerating of the race</em> through selection
of the unfit, and through the power of hereditary
transmission. It counteracts the positive or
destructive checks to the increase of population,
and thereby extends the area of general misery.
Nevertheless, at the same time, it increases the
strength and the solidarity of human society, and
becomes a new law of life. That law may be called
“Sympathetic Selection” and “Survival of the
Gentle.” Darwin in 1878 acknowledged its existence.
He recognized it as a law in human society
superseding that of Natural Selection and Survival
of the Fittest.</p>

<p class='c004'>In 1801 the population of England and Wales
was 8,892,536, or let us say about nine millions.
Eighty years later it had risen to about twenty-six
millions! The increase showed an accelerated rate
according to the census returns. Whereas in the
ten years between 1841 and 1851 the percentage of
increase was 12·65, in those from 1861 to 1871 it
was 13·19, and between 1871 and 1881 it was 14·34.
In the United Kingdom in 1900 there has been an
increase of 18 per cent. since 1880.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now Malthus had pointed out that with conditions
of life comparatively favourable, and an increase
of food supply comparatively easy, population
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>was found to double itself in twenty-five years
or less. Our numbers during these eighty years had
been, roughly speaking, trebled! and the increase
took place under conditions not favourable but
unfavourable to the bulk of the nation. Manufacturing
industries had enabled us to purchase food
from abroad, and consequently a larger number of
children survived. Food, however, cannot always
be forthcoming in greater and greater abundance
from countries that need more and more of their own
food supply, and which, by manufacturing for
themselves, are gradually reducing their demand
for our manufactured commodities.</p>

<p class='c004'>Notwithstanding this patent fact, there are social
reformers to-day who persist in ignoring the population
difficulty, and there are thinkers who, basing
their views on Herbert Spencer’s dictum that
“man’s fertility will be checked by his individuation,”
pass it over lightly. Generally speaking,
however, the public conscience is now aroused, and
enlightened men and women are tolerably well alive
to the fundamental nature and the grave importance
of the population question.</p>

<p class='c004'>“In some parts of the United States of America,”
says an able writer, “population has actually doubled
itself, apart from immigration, in twenty-five years;
and this in the face of the ordinary retarding influences.
If such a rate of increase upon the present
population of the whole globe were to prevail for
only 250 years, there would be left but one square
yard of standing room for each individual.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>Again: “If we grant that a scientific treatment
of crops would enable food supplies to keep pace
with population, and for this purpose supposing
that all the land in the planet Jupiter were available
for a market garden, it would not ultimately be
want of food but want of room that would put a stop
to the increase of the multitude.” But further, the
above author—a mathematician—examines what
the potentiality of increase represents on the
supposition that each individual merely died the
natural death of old age. “Under such favourable
conditions as the absence of war, famine and disease,
the race might treble its numbers in thirty years.
To show the significance of the numerical law, let
us imagine it to operate undisturbed 3,000 years
upon the progeny of a single pair. The number of
human beings finally existing would be expressed by
twice the 100th power of 3. An easy computation
will show that if these people were packed together,
allowing six cubic feet of space for each person, they
would fill up the whole solar system in every direction,
and extend beyond it to a distance 430 times
that of the planet Neptune. In fact, a solid sphere
of human beings would be formed having a diameter
of 2,400,000,000,000 miles. Such considerations
lead us to realize the absolute inevitableness of
Nature’s checks upon reproduction.” (<cite>Social Evolution
and the Evolution of Socialism</cite>, by George
Shoobridge Carr, M.A., Cantab.)</p>

<p class='c004'>Turning now from scientific speculation to recognized
authority in practical politics, let me quote
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>from a paper read at the Registrar-General’s office
on March 18, 1890, by Dr. William Ogle, Superintendent
of Statistics: “The population of England
and Wales is, as we all know, growing in a most
formidable manner, and though persons may differ
in their estimates of the time when that growth will
have reached its permissible limits, no one can doubt
that, if the present rate of increase be maintained,
the date of that event cannot possibly be very
remote.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Premising that the rate of increase is not due to
the birth-rate only, but also to a fall in the death-rate,
and that voluntary philanthropy and State
interference influence the latter, we pass to the
consideration of conditions that affect the marriage-rate—consequently
the birth-rate—in the artisan
and labouring classes, composing the bulk of the
nation. The Registrar-General, in his report for
the year 1876, wrote as follows: “The state of trade
and national industry is strikingly exhibited in the
fluctuations of the marriage-rate of the last nine years....
The period of commercial distress, which
began about the middle of 1866 and continued
during five years&#160;... influenced the marriage-rates
of these years, which were 17·5, 16·5, 16·1,
15·9, 16·1 and 16·7 (in the 1,000) respectively. In
1872 and 1873 the working classes became excited
under the rapid advance of wages and the diminution
of the hours of labour, and the marriage-rates
rose to 17·5 and 17·6 respectively.” In his report
for 1881 the Registrar-General again accentuated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>this important point: “The marriage-rate reflects
with much accuracy the condition of public welfare.”
And further on: “The birth-rate was at its maximum
in 1876, and fell uninterruptedly from that
date year by year in natural accordance with the
corresponding decline in the marriage-rate.” These
years represented another period of commercial
depression. We have here then incontrovertible
proof of the national tendency. The mass of our
people increase their numbers so soon as they are
more comfortable, and the marriage-rate for each
year may be called the pulse or indicator of the
nation’s economic well-being. Its fluctuations coincide
with the upward and downward movements of
commercial activity.</p>

<p class='c004'>In this connexion we have also to note that the
most rapid growth of our population is taking place
in the great industrial centres, the mining, manufacturing
and trading districts; and the type that
there prevails is necessarily affecting the British
race.</p>

<p class='c004'>By the Parliamentary return of marriages, births
and deaths registered in England and Wales in the
year 1881, it appeared that in different districts the
percentages of marriages varied considerably. It
was greater in the mining, manufacturing and
trading districts than in the farming districts, and
much higher in London than in the provinces. In
the district comprising Hertford, Buckingham,
Oxford, Bedford, Cambridge, the rate equalled
twelve persons per annum for each thousand of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>population. In London it was eighteen persons
for each thousand, and in the divisions which comprise
Yorkshire and Lancashire the rate was sixteen
and seventeen persons to each thousand. As regards
births, the proportions stated were somewhat
similar. In London there were thirty-five births to
one thousand of the population, whilst in the southeastern
division there were only thirty-one; but
the rate rose again to thirty-five and thirty-six in
the great manufacturing districts of the Midlands
and the North.</p>

<p class='c004'>Dr. Ogle’s examination of statistics on the subject
shows that this state of things has continued,
in its main features, up to the present day. “Men
marry,” he says, “in greater numbers when trade
is brisk. The fluctuations in the marriage-rate
follow the fluctuations in the amount of industrial
employment.” “The rates vary very greatly in
the different registration counties.” “In London
the rate is invariably high. Almost all the counties
in which the marriage-rate is high are counties in
which the population is also high of women engaged
in industrial occupations, and therefore presumably
in receipt of independent wages, while all the
counties in which the marriage-rate is very low are
also counties in which but a very small population
of the women are industrially occupied.” The
general drift of the figures leads to the conclusion
that early marriage is most common where there is
the largest amount of employment for women.</p>

<p class='c004'>The age at which marriage takes place is examined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>by Dr. Ogle as “a subject of scarcely less importance
than the rate in its bearing upon the growth of the
population.” And the point is of special interest
in view of the fact that delayed marriage was valued
by Malthus as a desirable preventive check. Dr.
Ogle finds that the lowest average age at marriage
for both bachelors and spinsters, viz., 25·6 and 24·2
respectively, was in 1873, the year in which the
marriage-rate was highest; and from that date to
the present time the ages have gone up gradually
but progressively in harmony with the general
decline in the marriage-rate. In 1888 the average
age of bachelors at marriage was 26·3 years, and of
spinsters was 24·7.</p>

<p class='c004'>Observe of late years there has been a slight
decline of the marriage-rate and a certain retardation
of marriage, consequently the birth-rate has
fallen, but says Dr. Ogle, “so also has the death-rate,
and almost in equal amount; so that the balance
between the two, or natural increment of the population,
has practically scarcely changed. We may,”
he observes, “dismiss altogether the notion that
any adequate check to the increase of population
is hereafter to be found in retardation of marriage.
Such retardation may defer the day when a stationary
population will be necessary, but, when that
day has come, will be insufficient to prevent further
growth. If a stationary population is to be obtained
by simple diminution of the marriage-rate,
that rate would have to be reduced 45 per cent.
below the lowest point it has ever yet reached. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>short, almost one-half of those who marry would
have to remain permanently celibate. This seems
as hopeless a remedy as the retardation.” He makes
clearer still this important matter: “If one-quarter
of the women who now marry were to remain permanently
celibate, and the remaining three-quarters
were to retard their marriages for five years, the
birth-rate would be reduced to the level of the
present death-rate. It is manifest that if the growth
of population is hereafter to be arrested&#160;... by
increase of permanent celibacy, or by retardation of
marriage, these remedies will have to be applied on
a scale so enormously in excess of any experience
as to amount to a social revolution.”</p>

<p class='c004'>What, then, is the present position?</p>

<p class='c004'>Population tends to increase faster than actual
subsistence. Obviously it cannot outrun the supply
of food because people cannot live upon nothing.
There ensues therefore a state of chronic starvation
among the most helpless, and premature deaths
keep population reduced to the means of subsistence.</p>

<p class='c004'>Let us glance at facts concerning London alone.
London now contains over 4,300,000 persons. Three
hundred thousand of these earn less than 18s. per
week per family, and live in a chronic state of want.
One person in every five will die in the workhouse,
hospital, or lunatic asylum. Moreover, the percentage
is increasing. Considering that comparatively
few of the deaths are those of children, it is
probable that one of every four London adults will
be driven into these refuges to die.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>One in every eleven of the whole population is a
pauper. One in every five of persons over 65 is a
pauper. The appalling statistics of the pauperism
of the aged are carefully concealed in all official
returns. In 1885 Canon Blackley found that 42·7
per cent. of deaths of persons over 60 in twenty-five
rural parishes were those of paupers. Very
many children in the Board Schools go to school
without sufficient food unless supplied gratuitously.
Over 30,000 persons in London have no home but
the fourpenny “doss-house” or the causal ward.
(<cite>Fabian Tracts</cite>, Nos. 10 and 17.)</p>

<p class='c004'>The death-rate of children in the poorest districts
of the East End of London is three times as great
as among the rich at the West End. In barbarous
ages the death-rate was, as far as we can learn, far
higher than now, and even now the death-rate of
children in Russia is extremely high.</p>

<p class='c004'>We have little cause to rejoice in the absence of
famine, pestilence and war so long as the lowering
of the death-rate—by sanitation, the hospital
system and the outcome generally of sympathetic
feeling—increases the proportion of human beings
in a state of chronic want, and produces a gradual
enfeeblement and deterioration of the human race.
Yet it is inconceivable that rationalized man could
withhold his efforts to reduce the death-rate in the
future because of the fatal effects of his philanthropic
action in the past.</p>

<p class='c004'>Darwin acknowledged this dilemma. In the year
1878 he somewhat sadly wrote: “The evils that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>would follow by checking benevolence and sympathy
in not fostering the weak and diseased would
be greater than by allowing them to survive and
procreate.” Ten years later Professor Huxley
wrote: “So long as unlimited multiplication goes
on, no social organization which has ever been devised,
no fiddle-faddling with the distribution of
wealth, will deliver society from the tendency to
be destroyed by the reproduction within itself in
its intensest form of that struggle for existence, the
limitation of which is the object of society.” (<cite>Nineteenth
Century</cite>, February, 1888.)</p>

<p class='c004'>Further than this he did not go; Huxley, like
Darwin, brings us up to the dilemma and leaves us
there. Not such, however, is the position of all
scientific men in the present day. “We stand on
the threshold of a new departure in social evolution,”
says the author already quoted, “a new and
potent factor in the process is about to make itself
felt. This factor is man’s intellect.... The intelligence
of man will act intelligently; population
will not be subjected to mere haphazard restriction;
it will be regulated with a wise adaptation of means
to an end.” (<cite>Social Evolution and the Evolution of
Socialism</cite>, G. S. Carr, pp. 65, 66.) Man’s intelligence
already perceives the right policy to pursue. It is
to lower the birth-rate, to limit births to a proportion
conformable with the food supply; in other words,
to create a painless, instead of a painful, equalization
of births and deaths.</p>

<p class='c004'>Is there any other means of escape from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>existent dilemma? I answer, there is none.
Emigration has sometimes been regarded as an
efficient check to over-population, and Dr. Ogle
allows that “hitherto some of the excess of births
over deaths has been met by emigration, or rather
by excess of emigration over immigration; but
never on such a scale as to free the country from more
than one-twentieth part of its redundant growth.”
Moreover, this minimum of good is counterbalanced
by evil, for emigration “carries off the more vigorous
and enterprising of our working men to the necessary
deterioration of the residue left at home.” And
further: “The facilities for successful emigration
are yearly diminishing; the time must inevitably
come—sooner or later—when this means of reducing
our population will altogether fail us.”</p>

<p class='c004'>In view of the obvious tendency of better conditions—when
brought about—to create a reduction
of the death-rate and an acceleration of the birth-rate,
eventuating in an increase of general misery,
neither Malthus, Darwin, Huxley, nor any other
great teacher of the past, has given us applicable
and available counsel. There only remains for us
now to consider Herbert Spencer’s opinion regarding
this all-important matter. He is credited with the
demonstration of a law of population wider than
the laws discerned by Malthus and Darwin. The
law is this: “Other things equal, multiplication
and individuation vary inversely, i.e. the rate of
reproduction of all living things becomes lowered
as the development is raised, and conversely.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>(Lecture on “Claims of Labour,” Edin., 1886,
Patrick Geddes.)</p>

<p class='c004'>We have to do with this so-called law in respect
only of its bearing on practical action. The corollary
deduced from it is: Individuate, educate and
refine your masses, for the rate of increase will fall
as organisms rise in the scale of culture.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now what are our prospects of any rapid advance
in individuation (development and culture) among
the seething masses of a people who are helpless
and frightfully overcrowded by the action of the
very law which individuation is to counteract?
In how long a period will the process be likely to
take effect? It is on the answer to these questions
that the worth of the principle as a law of practical
guidance for humanity must depend.</p>

<p class='c004'>Accepting it as a fact that in the families of our
higher classes the average number is distinctly
smaller than in the families of our lower classes,
let us look for a moment at some of the causes
creating this difference. First, in the higher classes
men may have mistresses whose children are unacknowledged;
and frequently they form the
marriage tie with heiresses whose hereditary tendency
is necessarily—as expounded by Francis
Galton—towards sterility. Second, women of the
higher classes are often delicate. They cannot
support the strain of frequent maternity. Is this
a condition that, in an advancing civilization, will
persist? By no means. The ideal of womanhood,
as of manhood, points to strength, not weakness—“a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>combination of brain power and skill with bodily
health and vigour. Many intellectual men are
physically robust and capable in a polygamous state
of patriarchal propagation.” (<cite>Over-population</cite>, John
M. Robertson.) And it is impossible to doubt that
a rational education, embracing free play to activities
hitherto denied to the sex, and promoting
physical development, will lift women to a superior
level of health and of physiological capacity. Third,
the higher classes avail themselves to some extent
of neo-Malthusian preventive checks, whereas the
mass of the people are either ignorant of them or
opposed to their use. Fourth, enforced celibacy
in the case of a large proportion of women of the
cultured classes is a cause of relatively fewer numbers.
Obviously it is from the “warrens of the
poor” that prolific life persistently springs. There
we have the highest rate of genesis; and as the
refined restrain propagation and limit their numbers,
the poor enter the breach and fill up the ranks from
their own inferior stock. Now, mark the result.
The individuating process is checked, and ultimately
fails, through the crowding out of the individuated.
What occurs, naturally, inevitably, by
the action of the process is a gradual subsidence,
finally a limiting of the individuating factor, the
very social force to which Herbert Spencer directs
attention! Surely it suffices to point out “that
no theory of the ultimate effects of mere refinement
on rate of increase can give us help while nine-tenths
of the human race are not refined, and not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>visibly in the way of becoming so.” (<cite>Over-population</cite>,
John M. Robertson.)</p>

<p class='c004'>We are compelled to dismiss Herbert Spencer’s
“law of population” as irrelevant to the situation,
and to declare that he has no more solved the riddle
of the Sphinx than have Malthus, Darwin and
Huxley.</p>

<p class='c004'>The population problem, as it faces us to-day, is
serious beyond all comparison. It is impossible to
over-estimate the importance of finding its true
solution. But while thousands of men and women
are ready now to admit the seriousness, nowhere as
yet has a movement appeared of united action
applicable and adequate to the exigency.</p>

  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER II<br /> <span class='large'>THE PROBLEM OF SEX</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>How glorious will be the awakening when man’s desires
will be honoured, his passions utilized, his labour exalted,
whilst life is loved, and ever and ever creates love afresh.—<span class='sc'>Zola.</span></p>

<p class='c008'>The Law of Population derives its force from
an innate, powerful instinct or passion in man, the
unguarded exercise of which brings about reproduction
of the species. The thing therefore of greatest
importance to general well-being is the discovery
of means whereby to prevent this imperious instinct
dominating and controlling the reproductive conditions—which
imperatively need to be governed by
reason and moral sense.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sexual instinct, irresponsibly exercised, keeps
population up to the margin of the means of subsistence—whatever
that may be at the time—perpetuates
disease, constitutional weakness and inherited
taint, and frustrates the community’s best efforts to
make life easier and happier to all.</p>

<p class='c004'>My immediate purpose is to show that the prevention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>of all this evil is possible, for rational man may
slowly and surely guide the above vital instinct
into a new course—a course that will lead to the
redemption of his physical nature, the purifying
and elevating of his intellectual and emotional
nature, and the direct creation of social virtue and
happiness.</p>

<p class='c004'>I must first point out the obstacles standing in the
way of this fundamental far-reaching readjustment.
There is a fatal ignorance of the true nature of the
instinct in question, there is an obstinate prejudice
that prevents frank discussion of the subject, there
is Puritan or ascetic feeling that shuns pleasure as
evil, and there is an optimistic fatalism which, basing
itself on Darwinian law—already superseded by
man’s interference—persists in the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laissez-faire</span></i>
policy, however suicidal.</p>

<p class='c004'>Sexual relations form the background of human
life and are the primary sources of our finest emotions.
Therefore the instinct that prompts to
sex-union ought to hold a supremely honourable
place in public estimation, and be carefully guarded
from reproach and every hurtful or degrading
condition. This great factor in physical and emotional
life stands, at present, in disgrace. It is
ignominiously repressed, it produces heart-rending
misery and unmitigated evil. Publicly and in
current literature, either it is ignored (hypocritically)
or misjudged and condemned; and all the time
privately it is intensely felt; and in every direction
throughout society its licentious, furtive indulgence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>swirls into the vicious circles of destruction, the
broken hearts and lives of women, the fallen dignity
and besmirched consciences of men.</p>

<p class='c004'>If we look at the matter of sexual intercourse
calmly and in the light of pure reason alone, we
must perceive that its intrinsic qualities are good,
not evil. It creates happiness in the giving and
receiving of pleasure, and the physiological exaltation
connected with pleasure promotes individual
health and buoyancy. To quote Herbert Spencer:
“Pleasure increases vitality and raises the tide
of life.” If man “eats and drinks immoderately,”
said W. R. Greg, “nature punishes him with dyspepsia
and disease; but nature never forbids him
to eat when he is hungry and to drink when he is
thirsty, provided he does so with discretion. Indeed,
she punishes him equally if he abstains, as if he
exceeds.” Mr. Greg further showed that the
action of nature is precisely similar in respect of the
sexual function. If man indulges to excess, he
is punished by premature exhaustion, with appropriate
maladies, not otherwise however. On the
contrary, enforced and total abstinence is punished
often, if not habitually, by “nervous disturbance
and suffering and by functional disorder.” (<cite>Enigmas
of Life</cite>, Chapter II.) Observe also the sexual desire
“is the especial one of all our animal wants which
is redeemed from animalism by being blended
with our strongest and least selfish affections;
which is ennobled by its associations in a way in which
the appetites of eating and drinking and sleeping can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>never be ennobled in a degree to which the pleasures
of the eye and ear can be ennobled only by assiduous
and lofty culture.” (<cite>Enigmas of Life.</cite> W. R.
Greg, p. 71.) We have no fastidious recoil from
eating and drinking because these are merely animal
functions. We take pains to improve our methods
of preparing food, and we embellish our repasts
with super-sensual surroundings in order to elevate
the nutritive functions and free them from grossness
or brutality. The fundamentally animal nature
of sexual passion does not imply brutality, it is
sociable to a far greater degree than eating or drinking,
and this element of sociality purifies and ennobles,
causing the function to become the basis of tender
unselfish love. In its physiological aspect we may
rest assured that the average normal human being
has as little inherent tendency to sexual excess as to
gluttony or drunkenness.</p>

<p class='c004'>But apart from the question of excess, an attitude
of mind towards the whole subject is common which
must be condemned. This attitude consists of an
element of shame, misnamed delicacy, and a sense
of moral superiority. Women chiefly cherish the
feeling, but men pay homage to it, with the result
that in no friendly communion of men and women
does it seem compatible with good taste to discuss
questions of sex.</p>

<p class='c004'>All vulgar allusions to love, all flippant talk on
the subject of sex are distinctly contrary to good
taste, they dishonour human nature, but I submit
that it is an outrage on common sense, and an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>immoral action, when students of the Population—or
any other grave social question—allow this
spurious delicacy to interfere with their facing the
whole facts of life, or to bias judgment in reasoning
from the facts.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the publication of my previous volume,
<cite>Scientific Meliorism and the Evolution of Happiness</cite>,
in 1885, a woman of superior intellect and
attainments reviewed the book. One passage in her
criticism stands thus: “A certain instinct that
in such matters the instinct of reprobation is as
healthy as it is superficially unreasonable, may
make one sicken at the suggestions of neo-Malthusianism.”
(<cite>The Academy</cite> of May 15th, 1886.)
Such squeamishness is no indication of health or
good taste. Its unreasonableness condemns it, and
the source from which it springs is prejudice induced
through specific conditions. The reviewer appears
to suspect as much, for, later she remarks: “One
cannot put down the book without a greatly increased
sense of the supreme necessity of criticizing
all established theories and institutions and of the
supreme duty of refraining from precipitate
action.” This is a sentiment one can endorse, and
I appeal to all my readers, especially to women, to
refrain from forming any judgment on any part of
this difficult, all-important problem, until they
have mastered the subject in all its aspects. To
pursue the opposite course is to act irrationally and
immorally. It causes to spring up in other minds
the prejudice which distorts and disguises truth.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>In nutritive functions, all repulsive animalism
becomes overborne, as human nature refines and
civilizes, and in a profounder sense the brutality
of sex-passion vanishes through the growth of a
higher love, which has for its dominant quality—not
eagerness for possession—but unselfish tenderness.
This tenderness, permeating the individual
and extending its benign influence into society,
issues in the gentle manners and virtuous actions
that seem to spring directly from a universal principle
of sympathy and love.</p>

<p class='c004'>The scientific exposition of the phenomena has
long been before the public. G. H. Lewes, in his
<cite>Problems of Life and Mind</cite>, demonstrated that
whilst the individual functions of man (alimentation
being one of these) arise in relation to the cosmos,
his general functions, including sex-appetite, arise
in relation to the social medium, and “animal
impulses become blended with human emotions,”
until “in process of evolution, starting from the
merely animal appetite of sexuality, we arrive at the
purest and most far-reaching tenderness.” The
social instincts, which he calls analogues of the
individual instincts, tend more and more to make
“sociality dominate animality and thus subordinate
personality to humanity.” (<cite>Problems of
Life and Mind</cite>, vol. 1, p. 159.)</p>

<p class='c004'>It is only recently that the full significance of
these facts has begun to influence general thought
and to create a revolt against the unscientific attitude
of mind that covers the sexual instinct with contumely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>and hypocritical disdain. There dawns
in consequence a new light upon the afflicting
problem of our social impurity. It is seen that the
horrible struggle for existence which makes grief
and pain, exhausting mental effort and physical
restraint, enter so largely into the lot of unhappy
man, is the paramount evil to cast out. “The
wonderful cycles of normal life are for ever clean
and pure.” (<cite>The New Spirit</cite>, Havelock Ellis.)
And with far more of sex-union—especially for the
young—and all the tender social joys that emanate
from that union, and far more of ease and happiness
in life, there becomes possible a great increase of
goodness.<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c015'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c004'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. It is well to know moments of material happiness, since
they teach us where to look for loftier joys.—<cite>Wisdom and
Destiny</cite>, by Maurice Maeterlinck.</p>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The late James Hinton spoke truly of the matter
when he said: “Sensuous pleasure will be to the
moral life of the future as sense-impressions are to
the knowledge of the present, and with the same
history. It will not be a thing put aside as evil
or degrading or misleading, but recognized as the
very basis and means of the life, and used with
enhancements and multiplied powers undreamt
of by us.” And again, “This is what sets the soul
on fire—the union of goodness and pleasure. It is
a new possibility, a hope we never saw before, a
means whereby all may be brought into goodness.”
(<cite>The Law Breaker</cite>, pp. 275, 236.) The key to the
position, he points out, is the taking of pleasure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>unselfishly and with complete regard to the happiness
of others.</p>

<p class='c004'>The region of sex is indeed to this day unreclaimed,
but, as Mr. Ellis asks: “Why should the sweetening
breath of science be guarded from this spot? Our
attitude towards this part of life affects profoundly
our attitude towards life altogether.” (<cite>The New
Spirit</cite>, pp. 127, 125). Which of us has not felt the
truth of that deep saying of Thoreau’s that “for him
to whom sex is impure there are no flowers in
nature.”</p>

<p class='c004'>It is precisely here that development in the sense
of purity gives a sure hope of moral regeneration.
And very remarkable is it that as in the old days
when prophetic poetry took the lead in all religious
reforms so now we have art in the van of social reform
boldly confronting the great enemies of progress—ignorance,
pride, prejudice and malicious insinuation.
When Ibsen’s “Ghosts” was first put upon the
stage of a London theatre, a dramatic critic delivered
himself thus: “It is a dream of revolt—the
revolt of the ‘joy of life’ against the gloom
of hidebound, conventional morality, the revolt of
the natural man and woman, the revolt of the individual
against the oppression of social prejudice.
The joy of life, the joy of life—it rings like a clarion
through the play.” (<cite>Star</cite> of March 14th, 1891.)
The fine women of Ibsen’s creation speak out
upon questions of sex with a pure, earnest candour
that breathes a new morality, and this moral element
is one of the central features in Whitman’s attitude
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>towards sex. For the lover, there is nothing in
the loved one impure or unclean; a breath of passion
has passed over, and all things are sweet. For
most of us this influence spreads no farther, for the
man of strong moral instinct it covers all human
things in infinitely widening circles; his heart goes
out to every creature that shares the loved one’s
delicious humanity, henceforth there is nothing
human that he cannot touch with reverence and love.
<cite>Leaves of Grass</cite> is penetrated by this moral
element. (<cite>The New Spirit</cite>, Havelock Ellis, p.
123.)</p>

<p class='c004'>Walt Whitman himself says: “Difficult as it
will be, it has become, in my opinion, imperative
to achieve a shifted attitude from superior men
and women towards the thought and fact of sexuality
as an element in character, personality, the emotions,
and a theme in literature.” (<cite>How I made a
Book.</cite> An Essay by Walt Whitman.)</p>

<p class='c004'>The principles underlying the new morality may
be thus stated: Goodness does not consist in
starving or denying any normal animal appetite,
therefore chastity in the sense of total abstinence is
essentially immoral. Life is not so prodigal of
joys that man can wisely forego any source of
innocent happiness, hence asceticism has no place
in a rational theory and code of morals. The
course for rational man to adopt in reference to
sexual appetite is duly to satisfy and regulate it;
and by removing every loathsome condition that
superinduces degradation, to compel it to raise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>the tide of life in promoting individual comfort
and general virtue.</p>

<p class='c004'>To the reader who grasps the population problem
it may seem that this moral code would place society
on the horns of a painful dilemma, for while morality
is said to require a closer union between the sexes
than has hitherto prevailed, propagation—which
is the actual result of that union—must be limited
to an extent hitherto unknown, and by many
people deemed impossible of attainment. By its
patient investigations of nature, however, science here
comes to the rescue of those whose standpoint in viewing
the sexual problem is one of ardent sympathy
with the essential needs and the moral aspirations
of man in a social position truly pathetic.</p>

<p class='c004'>Physiology has revealed that sexual organs are
naturally divided into amative and reproductive
organs, each class functionally distinct from the
other. Amative organs relate primarily to sexual
union, while reproductive organs relate primarily
to impregnation and gestation. The process of
reproduction may take place without use of the
amative organs by simply bringing spermatozoa
to ova (this has been done), and on the other hand
the amative organs can be exercised without effecting
reproduction. Sexual intercourse and procreation
are not vitally related, as they are ordinarily assumed
to be.</p>

<p class='c004'>Moreover, the instincts connected with sexual
union and with offspring are separate and distinct.
In popular, confused thought, a reproductive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>instinct is attributed to animals and man. In
reality, no direct instinct to reproduce the species
exists. Animals unite sexually from an instinct
directed to a pleasurable exercise of function;
and although, in man, the relation has been made
complex by his knowledge of the facts of reproduction
and of social life, the sexual instinct is connected
solely with pleasure and social feeling—not with
reproduction. On the other hand, instincts associated
with the presence and nurture of the young are
not sexual or related to sexual passion. Therefore
any doctrine requiring man’s exercise of the sexual
function to be restricted to the end of reproduction
is without justification in nature and directly
conflicts with the facts of life.</p>

<p class='c004'>The sexual act, in the natural order of things,
is only occasionally in accidental relation to the
reproductive process, for with married people in
a thousand acts only a dozen may be reproductive.
If social morality then requires the satisfaction
of normal sexual feeling—and I think I have shown
this to be the case—the desideratum is to prevent
at will instead of leaving to accident the above
occasional relation, and make the separation between
amative and reproductive conditions as complete
as their functional separation.</p>

<p class='c004'>An American writer has well said: “If there
is one social phenomenon which human ingenuity
ought to bring completely under the control of the
will, it is the phenomenon of procreation.” “Just
as everyone is his own judge of how much he shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>eat and drink, of what commodities he wants to
render life enjoyable, so everyone should be his
own judge of how large a family he desires, and
should have power in the same degree to leave
off when the requisite number is reached.” (Lester
F. Ward. <cite>Dynamic Sociology</cite>, vol. 2, p. 465.)
The Bible Communists of Oneida Creek practised
voluntary control over the propagative function
during thirty years with marked success. The
number of births was regulated in accordance
with the wishes of the community, and such careful
attention was paid to the laws of heredity that no
children of defective organisms or unsound constitutions
were born. Were man universally intelligent
and morally self-controlled, the knowledge of
physiological facts and of invention applied to those
facts would suffice to create general spontaneous
limitation of the birth-rate and hygienic propagation
of species. But one has only to think of the battered
humanity in the back slums of every great city—the
physical, mental and moral weaklings of our
degraded populace—to realize that it is fantastic
folly to expect individual intelligence under vicious
and utterly depressing conditions, to counteract
habit and save society from a rising tide of overwhelming
numbers, the product of random pregnancy
and sportive chance.</p>

<p class='c004'>It cannot be a solution nor even a relief to the
population difficulty that the intelligent—comparatively
few—should limit their families so long as
the masses refuse or fail to limit theirs. When
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>society, becoming fully alive to the imminent danger
of a too rapid birth-rate solves the population and
social problems combined—in the only way possible—it
will facilitate and promote the use of
scientific checks to conception, and, if necessary,
exact their adoption by some legislative device.
(See <cite>Social Control of the Birth-rate</cite>, by G. A.
Gaskell.)</p>

<p class='c004'>By the aid of these personal means of avoiding
or preventing conception the desired complete
separation of amative and reproductive conditions
is effected. Love is set free to rule in its own
domain, and reason controls procreation to the
infinite benefit of all future generations. In an
article by Mr. J. Holt Schooling in the <cite>Contemporary
Review</cite> for February, 1902, entitled “The Natural
Increase of Three Populations,” it is shown how
widely in the United Kingdom the use of preventive
checks has spread within the last twenty years.
The writer says in comparing the birth-rates of
Germany, England and France since 1880: “There
has been a fall in the birth-rate during each period
in each country. But England’s fall has been
larger than all; larger than the fall in the French
birth-rate. During 1880–1884 there were 323 births
per year per 10,000 of our population; during
1895–1899 there were only 291 births per year
per 10,000 of population—a yearly fall of 32 births
per 10,000 of population. France’s fall was 28
births and Germany’s fall was only 10 births,
although Germany’s birth-rate was higher throughout
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>than that of England or of France.” This is
very satisfactory, and in regard to the strength
of a nation that depends upon the adults, and
there are more adults in a population where the
children are fewer. The death-rate in England
during the last twenty years has been always the
lowest of the three countries.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the present moment, society has no scientific
sex-philosophy whatever. It affects to be governed
by Puritanism—a vague doctrine belonging to the
past history of the race and not in connexion
with any ethical code directed to the development
of goodness through a careful regard to the happiness
of man and the satisfaction of his normal
human nature. Puritanism, whether affected or
real, spreads abroad hypocrisy, deceit, lying; it
tends to licentiousness in men and the utter defilement
of women, to social disorder and decay.
Above all, it frustrates the development of that
higher love, which, having animalism allied, but
subordinate, fills the mind with exquisite emotion
and creates unselfish delights.</p>

<p class='c004'>Many years ago Miss Martineau wrote: “A
thing to be carefully remembered is that asceticism
and licentiousness universally co-exist. All experience
proves this, and every principle of human
nature might prophesy the proof. Passions and
emotions cannot be extinguished by general rules.”
(<cite>How to observe Morals and Manners</cite>, p. 169.)
Puritanism ignores the sexual needs of the young.
In a scientific age man is bound to recognize physiological
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>reasons for early satisfaction of the sexual
appetite and physiological reasons for delayed
parentage.</p>

<p class='c004'>Of the former, I have here to say that an early
moderate stimulation of the female sexual organs
(after puberty is reached) tends, by the law of
exercise promoting development of structure, to
make parturition in mature life easy and safe; and
that the healthy functional and emotional life of
love and gratified passion is the best preventive
of hysteria, chlorosis, love melancholy, and other
unhappy ailments to which our young women are
cruelly and barbarously exposed, and which, I do
not hesitate to say, make them in many cases feel
their youth to be an almost insufferable martyrdom.</p>

<p class='c004'>There are no less serious sexual evils which overtake
masculine youth, if continent, namely, persistent
and miserable cravings, abnormally directed instinct,
spermatorrhoea, self-abuse; and these are usually
hidden from sight and knowledge in consequence
of a feeling that, in sexual matters, adults have no
sympathy with the young.</p>

<p class='c004'>In <cite>Lecky’s History of European Morals</cite>,
vol. 2, p. 301, prostitution is thus referred to:—“However
persistently society may ignore this form
of vice, it exists, nevertheless, and on the most
gigantic scale, and an evil rarely assumes such
inveterate and perverting forms as when it is
shrouded in obscurity and veiled by a hypocritical
appearance of unconsciousness. The existence in
England of unhappy women, sunk in the very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>lowest depths of vice and misery&#160;... shows
what an appalling amount of moral evil is festering
uncontrolled, undiscussed and unalleviated under
the fair surface of decorous society.” The number
of London prostitutes was estimated at 80,000 in the
year 1870. Since then, it has probably increased.
In Paris, according to Von Dettingen, the actual number
at that period was upwards of 60,000; in Berlin,
25,000 to 30,000. In Hamburg, in 1860, every
ninth woman above the age of 15 was a prostitute,
and in Leipzig the women depending principally
or exclusively on prostitution was estimated at
2,000. This field of prostitution encloses whole
armies of women finding there their only means
of earning a miserable livelihood and a corresponding
number of victims claimed by death and disease.
(<cite>Woman in the Past, Present and Future.</cite> August
Bebel, pp. 100–101.)</p>

<p class='c004'>The prostitute, in her thousands; the married
drudge, weary of child-bearing; the desolate old
maid; these are all alike victims to social oppression.
They are compelled to abstain from, or compelled to
engage in, a specific function which is only natural,
pleasurable, healthful and virtuous in the absence
of all tyranny. Love to be real must be prompted
by personal desire, and free to express itself in
unhurtful conditions: I mean conditions that
involve individual liberty, social respect and human
dignity. The facts of prostitution alone would
amply suffice to put Puritanism out of court in
social reform. As a result of conduct, it has no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>control over vicious propensities, whilst it restrains
tormentingly impulses that are normal and virtuous,
that need only fitting conditions of healthful
freedom.</p>

<p class='c004'>Discarding asceticism and conventional purism
as alike immoral, the social reforms that are based
on a knowledge of human nature and a knowledge
of the possibilities allied with conscious evolution,
will bring all the institutions of our social life into
accordance with the needs of the individual; and
one essential condition of happy life is sexual
love, with such union of the sexes as conforms to the
general or collective interests.</p>

<p class='c004'>In view of the law of population, and the fact
that science has made plain how practically to
separate the amative from the reproductive conditions
of physical union, the love of the sexes can
harmonize with the highest interests of our collective
social life, and eugenics, <em>not sexual love</em>, may become
paramount in generation.</p>

<p class='c004'>What social morality requires is that the forces
of philoprogenitiveness and a public conscience
combined should dominate the function of reproduction,
while love is left free from coercive control in
the sphere of individual life.</p>

<p class='c014'>The first step towards the reduction of disease is beginning
at the beginning to provide for the health of the unborn.—Dr.
<span class='sc'>Richardson</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The whole theory concerning heredity and its
marvellous influence for good or evil is a nauseous
draught for mankind to swallow. No wonder
we revolt instinctively from a doctrine that charges
tender parents with transmitting an evil heritage
to the offspring they passionately love. “Although
many important books draw attention to the
facts, as far as they are ascertained, these momentous
facts have as yet made no impression on the general
mind.” (<cite>Scientific Meliorism and the Evolution
of Happiness</cite>, p. 329.) This statement is no longer
true. It was written in 1884, and since then
immense strides have been made in the realization
of the action of heredity. The subject is frequently
and persistently brought forward now, and urged
upon the attention of the public. Zola’s <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mère idée</span></i>
is not found only in French fiction, the new Russian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>school of fiction is permeated by it; and even in
England some novelists, following in the footsteps of
George Eliot, are assuming a scientific attitude
towards life, and the facts of heredity are not
ignored.</p>

<p class='c004'>Moreover, in science and in all high-class criticism
of life the doctrine of heredity is directly taught.</p>

<p class='c004'>Apart from purely literary work, the examination
of criminal statistics as a whole, and the practical
observations of physicians, doctors, dentists, schoolmasters,
poor-guardians, systematized and made
public at congresses and stored in scientific handbooks
so inexpensive as to be well within reach
of all students—these, I say, combine to impress
upon the general mind the conviction that racial
degeneracy is a palpable fact; and that inheritance
is prime factor in the degenerating process. And
recently indeed a suspicion of danger in over-estimating
this factor has been publicly expressed.
Whereas formerly, it is said, a child was supposed to
be born with a mind like a clean sheet of paper,
on whose fair surface we might write what we chose,
opinion points in the present day to an opposite
extreme, viz., this, that the hereditary tendencies
born with the child determine its future career,
and that education cannot modify this destiny in any
essential respect. Now, to disallow the importance
of education as also a prime factor in progress
is an error of judgment; but so long as the human
race continues scourged by sickness, martyred by
pain, demoralized by disease and innate debility,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>and decimated by premature death, it is not possible
for thinkers to over-estimate the profound significance
for weal or woe of this question of heredity.</p>

<p class='c004'>Where individual life is not menaced by poverty
or destitution, disease is the bane of existence,
the barrier to physical comfort and to both mental
and moral advance. Alas! how few of us have
any permanent possession of sound health. In
spite of medical science, sanitary protection, progress
made during the last hundred years in knowledge
of pathological conditions, and vast resources
now at our command for subduing and mitigating
every form of physical evil, disease dogs our footsteps
from infancy to maturity and onwards to the
grave. We have the young attacked by consumption,
the middle-aged suffering from failing health,
the aged struck by paralysis or bowed down by
rheumatism; and everywhere we meet husbands
and wives permanently saddened by the loss of the
chosen companion of their life, and mothers whose
light-hearted buoyancy died out for ever when the
babe, prized beyond all treasure, was snatched from
their arms to be laid in our appallingly numerous
children’s graves.</p>

<p class='c004'>In order to form an approximately correct conception
of disease, we must glance for a moment
at the conditions of health. Life in all its forms,
physical or mental, morbid or healthy, is in close
relation to the individual organism and external
forces. Health, as the consequence and evidence
of a successful adaptation to the conditions of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>existence, implies the preservation, well-being and
development of the organism; while disease marks
a failure in organic adaptation to external conditions,
and leads to disorder, decay and death.</p>

<p class='c004'>If we could perceive all the conditions, outward
and inward, and take them into account, a distinct
line of causation would become apparent. We
should find disease no more an accident than the
storm that breaks upon the seaboard or the volcanic
flames that burst from the mountain top. The
extreme complexity and delicacy of biological
phenomena precludes a wide grasp of conditions
in individual cases, but scientific investigation
has established the point that of the antecedents
to disease the largest proportion is some heritage
of weakness transmitted from parents—some disabilities
for healthy life resulting from a bad descent.</p>

<p class='c004'>When, for instance, mental anxiety produced by
adverse circumstances is said to have made a man
mad, there is implied some inherent infirmity
of nervous element which has co-operated. “Were
the nervous system in a state of perfect soundness
and in possession of that reserve power which it
then has of adapting itself, within certain limits,
to the varying external conditions, it is probable,”
says Maudsley, “that the most unfavourable
circumstances would not disturb permanently the
relation and initiate mental disease. But when
unfavourable action from without conspires with
an infirmity of nature within, then the conditions
of disorder are established and a discord or madness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>is produced.” (<cite>The Physiology and Pathology
of the Mind</cite>, p. 199.)</p>

<p class='c004'>Thus although outward circumstances often
decide the character of a disease, inherited infirmity
is its primary cause. A being liable to madness,
if subjected to anxiety, may, under different conditions,
acquire not madness but consumption. A
child may fall a victim to the special ailment from
which one or both parents suffered; but equally it is
possible that disease in him may assume a totally
different form. All that can be affirmed with
certainty is this: of diseased parents the offspring
invariably inherit a constitution liable to “some
kind of morbid degeneration, or a constitution
destitute of that reserve power necessary to meet
the trying occasions of life!”</p>

<p class='c004'>The trying occasions of life have multiplied
with every new complexity in social structure;
and there has been no corresponding increase of
constitutional strength; but, on the contrary, a
growing feebleness of physique and instability of
nerve-function. “Our children in these times,”
remarks Dr. Richardson, “are our reproach. Where
is there a healthy child? You may put before
me a child showing to the unskilled mind no trace of
disease.... It is sure to have some inherited
failure. We are as yet unacquainted with all the
phenomena of disease that pass in the hereditary
line.... We admit, as proved, scrofula or struma,
cancer, consumption, epilepsy, rheumatism, gout.
It would be wrong to limit the hereditary proclivities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>of disease to this list. The further my own observations
extend, the stronger is the impression made
on my mind that the majority of the phenomena
of disease have hereditariness of character.” (<cite>Diseases
of Modern Life</cite>, p. 38.) Sir James Paget and
Sir William Jenner gave evidence of a similar kind
before a Committee of the House of Lords in 1882.
From the former eminent physician’s speech I
may quote one passage: “We now know that
certain diseases of the lungs, liver and spleen are all
of syphilitic origin, and the mortality from syphilis
in its later forms is every year found to be larger
and larger, by its being found to be the source of
a number of diseases which previously were referred
to other origins.” (<cite>The Times</cite> Report, August 11th,
1882.)</p>

<p class='c004'>In August Bebel’s work on <cite>Woman, her Position
in the Past, Present and Future</cite>, this passage occurs:
“With regard to the decimating effects of venereal
disease, we will only mention that in England
between 1857 and 1865 the authenticated cases
which ended fatally amounted to over 12,000,
among which no fewer than 69 per cent. were
children under twelve months, the victims of parental
infection.” (p. 101.)</p>

<p class='c004'>Of the original source from which syphilis sprang,
of its implication in the sex problem, and of the
ultimate eradication of its virus—to be attained
only by the true solution of the sex problem—we
cannot here speak; the point under immediate
consideration is the fact that the civilized races of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>mankind persist in propagating and perpetuating
disease. They unscrupulously bring into the
world individual organisms that are pre-destined
to failure because not endowed with the potential
qualities indispensable to complete and successful
life.</p>

<p class='c004'>In America the same conditions are noted and
publicly referred to. Mr. Nathan Allen, M.D.,
before a medical society at Massachusetts, reported:
“A gradual change is taking place in the organization
of our New England people—a change which
has occurred principally within the last two or
three generations. The nervous temperament with
all its advantages and disadvantages is becoming too
predominant for other parts of the body. The
frame-work of the body generally is not so large&#160;...
the countenance is paler, the features are more
pointed and not so expressive of health. We have
a larger class of diseases arising from general debility&#160;... we have more disease of the brain and
nervous system, more sudden deaths from apoplexy,
paralysis, and also diseases of the heart. In sound
healthy stock we have in a far higher degree the
recuperative powers of nature; while the original
constitution is feeble, diseases of almost every kind
become complicated, and their treatment more
difficult as well as doubtful in result.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Laws of inheritance affect the moral as well as
the physical and mental health of the nation.
Their action is fatally legible in the public records
of crime. Not that many criminals inherit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>the actual attributes of crime—brutality, cruelty,
malignity, propensity to abnormal sexual practices—these
develop through the interaction of
external with internal forces—but the ordinary
criminal is born deficient in the elemental qualities
necessary to the establishment of the average
moral nature.</p>

<p class='c004'>From observations carried on in English prisons,
it appears that in these days of careful school-board
education 25 per cent. of prisoners can neither
read nor write, and a certain number are quite
incapable of receiving and benefiting by school
instruction. “The memory and reasoning powers
are so utterly feeble that attempts to school them
is a waste of time.” (<cite>Crime and its Causes</cite>, William
Douglas Morrison, of H.M. Prison, Wandsworth,
p. 195.) Intellectually, criminals are “unquestionably
less gifted than the rest of the community”;
emotionally they “have the family sentiment
only feebly developed,” and morally the will
is “morbidly variable.” A prisoner may be animated
by good resolutions, anxious to do what is
right, often possessing a sense of moral responsibility,
yet may plunge again and again into crime from
the absence of a sustained power of volition.
“Persons afflicted in this way are generally convicted
for crimes of violence, such as assault, manslaughter,
murder. They experience real sentiments
of remorse, but neither remorse nor penitence
enables them to grapple with their evil star. The
will is stricken with disease, and the man is dashed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>hither and thither a helpless wreck on the sea of
life.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The harmony of the social organism depends
upon congruity of thought and feeling in its members
and upon action made promptly conformable
through exercise of the power of control centred in
the inner part or spiritual nature of man.</p>

<p class='c004'>A criminal is an unsocial man, an undeveloped
being, one, generally speaking, whose pregenital stock
was below par, and failed in the conservation,
development and transmission of a physical, mental
and moral capacity equalling that of the average
of his race. The physical debility or inherited
tendency to nerve weakness—so universal in the
present day—has clearly a causal relation with
the increase of crime deplored by the principal
authorities on the subject in Europe and America.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the United States we are told by Mr. D. A.
Wells and by Mr. Howard Wines, an eminent
specialist in criminal matters, that crime is steadily
increasing at a faster rate than in due proportion to
the increase of population. Nearly all the chief
statisticians abroad tell the same tale. Dr. Mischler,
of Vienna, and Professor Von Liszt, of Marburg,
draw a deplorable picture of the increase of crime in
Germany. In France, the criminal problem is as
formidable and perplexing as in Germany. M.
Henri Joli estimates that crime has increased 133
per cent. within the last half century, and is steadily
rising. Taking Victoria as a typical Australasian
colony, we find that even in the antipodes, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>are not vexed to the same extent as Europe with
social and economic difficulties, crime is persistently
raising its head&#160;... it is a more menacing danger
among the Victorian Colonists than it is at home.
(<cite>Crime and its Causes</cite>, W. D. Morrison. Published
in 1891, pp. 12 and 13.)</p>

<p class='c004'>While physical degeneracy creates crime, a non-moral
life on the other hand causes further physical
deterioration. The pursuit of wealth for purely
personal ends is pre-eminently anti-social. Breadth
of thought and social feeling grow impossible to the
man whose life is devoted to the business of amassing
riches; and Dr. Henry Maudsley gives it as his
conviction, based upon wide observation of family
life, that such men are extremely unlikely to beget
healthy children. In cases where the father has
toiled upwards from poverty to vast wealth, “I
have witnessed the results,” he says, “in a degeneracy
mental and physical of his offspring which
has sometimes gone as far as extinction of the family
in the third or fourth generation. I cannot but
think after what I have seen that the extreme
passion for getting rich does predispose to mental
degeneration in the offspring, either to moral defect
or to moral and intellectual deficiency, or to outbreaks
of positive insanity under the conditions of
life.” (<cite>The Physiology and Pathology of the Mind</cite>,
p. 206.)</p>

<p class='c004'>This fact alone is amply sufficient to condemn an
industrial system that creates monopolies, concentrates
wealth, stimulates greed, degrades the upper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>classes by superfluous luxury, the lower by envy,
poverty, despair, and tends generally to physical,
mental and moral decay. But were the entire
economic system judiciously reconstructed, fatal
elements would remain so long as man fails to grapple
with the biological problem and fails to bring the
great life forces of reproduction under conscientious
direction and control.</p>

<p class='c004'>Gravitation and all well studied mechanical and
chemical forces have been adapted by man to special
purposes in relation with his civilized life; even so
must the sexual forces that belong to his basic
existence be in their turn dominated and made
conformable with his higher moral and spiritual
needs. In this regard his primary need is that there
shall be no transmission of disease or constitutional
debility from one generation to another; but that
the entire strength of the laws of heredity shall
create an improvement of stock and thereby lift
humanity to a higher level of physical health and
efficiency.</p>

<p class='c004'>In seeking the true method of attaining this end,
it is our duty to look first to the teaching of the great
founders of social philosophy. Without their invaluable
services in discovering and setting forth the one
unbroken process of law which “connects all
phenomena from the motion of molecules and the
courses of the suns to the phenomena of human
thought and the destinies of nations” (J. M. Robertson),
no intellects could to-day grasp the causes of
misery and, conceiving the possibility of circumventing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>these causes, devise a scheme of scientific
action to reverse the trend of general movement
and evolve conditions of genuine and universal
happiness.</p>

<p class='c004'>In <em>this</em> sphere, however—the sphere of <em>eugenics</em>,
or improvement of the human stock, as also in
regard to the population and sex problems—Darwin
and Herbert Spencer have failed us. The
mind of the former, habituated to dwell on the
favourable aspects of the struggle for existence
during the early epochs of man’s history, was blind
to the consequences of the genesis and growth of
the broadly social element in man. Barbarous man
could let cosmic forces prevail to exterminate the
weak. Sympathetic man is compelled by virtue of
his enlarged subjective nature to institute a new
struggle, viz., a struggle against the struggle for
existence (a phrase used by Lange), and already his
triumph is everywhere visible in the survival of the
unfit to struggle.</p>

<p class='c004'>Darwin opposed the proposal to restrain population
on the score that this would minimize the
struggle which had created civilization in the past
and which must needs, he thought, carry it on in
the future, and both Darwin and Herbert Spencer
“assumed that a generalization which sums up the
progressive forces of a collectively unconscious
society, i.e. a society without the conception of
evolution and of a universal sociology, must equally
sum up the progressive principles of a collectively
<em>conscious</em> society, a society which has realized
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>evolution and is constructing a universal sociology.
Though they themselves are our greatest helpers
towards such consciousness, they failed to realize
that our attainment of it must revolutionize human
history.” (<cite>Modern Humanists</cite>, J. M. Robertson,
p. 234).</p>

<p class='c004'>Turning then to less illustrious men, Mr. Francis
Galton is our most advanced teacher in the field of
eugenics. He faces the problem of race regeneration
and has put forth a scheme or policy of action,
resting on Dr. Matthews Duncan’s alleged facts
regarding the relative fertility in early and late
marriages. He shows that a group of a hundred
mothers whose marriages and those of their daughters
should take place at the age of twenty, would, in the
course of a few generations, breed down a group of a
hundred mothers whose marriages and those of
their daughters were delayed until the age of twenty-nine.
Let us then, he reasons, promote by every
means in our power the early marriage of human
beings of superior quality, whilst we discountenance
early marriage in those social members who are less
favourably endowed. And “few,” he says, “would
deserve better of their country than those who
determine to live celibate lives through a reasonable
conviction that their issue would probably be less
fitted than the generality to play their part as
citizens.” (<cite>Inquiries into Human Faculty</cite>, p. 336.)</p>

<p class='c004'>In examination for official appointments he would
have attention paid to a candidate’s ancestral qualifications
as well as his personal ability. The man of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>inherited sound constitution and average ability
should be preferred to the man of superior ability
who belongs to a delicate and short-lived family.
The former will in all probability become the more
valuable servant of the two. Some scheme should
be devised by which to bestow marks for family
merit, to put, as it were, a guinea stamp to the
sterling guinea’s worth of natural nobility; and this,
he conceives, might set a great social avalanche in
motion. It would open the eyes of every family,
and of society at large, to the importance of marriage
alliance with a good stock; it would introduce the
subject of race as a permanent topic of consideration,
and lead to a careful collecting of family histories
and noting of those facts which are absolutely
necessary for guidance in right conduct. Late
marriage, as advised by Malthus, Mr. Galton utterly
condemns. The prudent alone are influenced by
that doctrine, and it is, he says, a most pernicious
rule of conduct in its bearing upon race. His policy,
then, is early and fruitful marriage for the best
specimens of our race, and widespread celibacy in
the case of those less highly favoured, whilst everywhere
the sentiment should prevail that <em>eugenics</em>, or
the improvement of the human stock, is the primary
consideration in marriage and the guiding principle
in sex relations.</p>

<p class='c004'>This theory I hold to be one-sided, and the policy
misleading and to some extent false. Mr. Galton
ignores the fundamental principle of social life, viz.,
that the happiness of all, at all times, should be the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>aim and object of rational man, and he mistakes the
quality of human nature in highly civilized man.
To demand celibacy of men and women whose
defective organisms it is not desirable to perpetuate,
would be in hundreds and thousands of instances
to sacrifice unnecessarily present happiness to
future gain—to build up the comfort and enjoyment
of coming generations at the expense of the comfort
and enjoyment of our own generation. The sentiment
of justice repudiates this action as well as
condemns the reverse position of a reckless self-indulgent
procreating to the deterioration of the
human stock, whilst reason distinctly shows that
individual liberty, in respect of marriage, is a social
necessity perfectly compatible with the well-being
of all. Physical regeneration of race will not be
achieved by an overstrained morality that does
violence to the emotional human nature of the
normal and average man.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Galton’s system of social reform accords in
some respects with that which it is the purpose of
this work to set forth. Both systems premise
teaching that it is man’s duty and within his power
to improve the physical, intellectual and moral
structure of his race. He may, in part, achieve this
by intelligent forethought and careful action in
exercising the function of propagating his kind.
Population must not be kept up by consumptives
or persons whose pedigree is tainted by any disease
known to be hereditary, and public opinion must
enforce the necessary restraints. (Temporary illness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>ought also to be considered. It is when parents are
in their best state of health only that they are
morally justified in bringing children into the
world.)</p>

<p class='c004'>Of these, celibacy is a restraint commended and
advised by Mr. Galton, whilst scientific meliorism
deliberately rejects it, for celibacy is a vital evil,
destroying individual happiness and tending obviously
to social disorder. Wherever love in its
highest form exists between two individuals, union
is eminently desirable; but if either or both be
afflicted by disease or hereditary taint, the sacrifice
demanded of them is to carefully abstain from
giving birth to children. Whether the means
adopted be those of natural self-control or of artificial
aids to self-control will depend on the views
of the individuals immediately concerned, and in
this matter society has no right of interference.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is the business, however, of society to sweep
away ignorance and make it possible for the poor as
well as the rich to enter on the right path voluntarily,
and where, from physical or moral degeneracy,
self-regulation is impossible, society must exercise
authority and coercively restrain the vital social
force of propagation. It will not be by means of the
lonely lives celibacy entails that civilized men and
women will refrain from having children disqualified
for useful citizenship. We shall, to quote the late
poet laureate’s words, “move upward, working out
the beast, and let the ape and tiger die,” by other
means more worthy of humanity, i.e. by socialized
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>freedom and sex equality; by intelligent self-control
voluntarily practised (with or without artificial
appliance), and by control, enforced wherever
necessary by the State in fulfilment of its responsible
duty—the careful guardianship of the congenital
blood of future generations.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the savage epoch of our history, the force of
natural selection produced survival of the fittest.
From that epoch we have long since passed into a
semi-civilized epoch in which the force of sympathetic
selection produces a miserable state of indiscriminate
survival; we have now to pass forward to the epoch
in which the rational force of a wise, intelligent
selection will systematically secure the birth of the
physically fit.</p>

  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <span class='large'>MARRIAGE</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Marriage is that union of the sexes which is most in
accordance with the moral and physical necessities of
human beings and which harmonizes best with their other
relations of life.—<span class='sc'>Richard Harte.</span></p>

<p class='c008'>It is of vast importance to bear clearly in mind that
all the great social institutions that confront us to-day
are of genetic origin and evolution. They have
not been devised by man to bring about the true
end of all intelligent effort—namely, happiness.
They are simply the undesigned, unforeseen results
of various natural and social forces of the past. They
survive through their tendency to maintain the
existence of the race. They subserve life, not happiness.
It is not my intention to treat marriage
historically and trace back the various forms of it
to their social origins. It is sufficient to bear in
mind the fact of the natural, undevised origin of
every form, including that form of monogamy which
prevails in the most civilized countries of to-day.
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">A priori</span></i>, we should have expected that monogamy,
being the ideal sex-union of the civilized races of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>Western Europe, would have been everywhere the
last form to appear; that, in short, its fitness to
survive all other forms would be shown by lateness
of development as well as by superior qualifications
for satisfying the needs of a highly developed
humanity. This is not so, however. Mr. Herbert
Spencer gives reasons for believing that monogamy
dates as far back as any other marital relation.
“Indeed, certain modes of life necessitating wide
dispersion such as are pursued by the lowest forest
tribes in Brazil and the interior of Borneo—modes of
life which in earlier stages of human evolution must
have been commoner than now—hinder other relations
of the sexes.” (<cite>Sociology</cite>, vol. i. p. 698.) Two
of the lowest tribes of savages existing, the Wood-Veddahs
of Ceylon and the Bushmen of South Africa,
are customarily monogamous. It is plain, therefore,
that if monogamy is to be reckoned the final form of
sexual relations, no argument can be based on any
theory of its recent date in evolution. The opinion
must seek to rest upon different ground—upon the
quality of the institution, its fitness and adequateness,
not only to human needs in the present system of
society, but in the reformed system of the future.</p>

<p class='c004'>While a number of primitive tribes are monogamous,
as also are certain monkeys and birds, many
civilized peoples have adopted polygamy, sometimes
openly, at other times in a masked form. Polyandry
is also a form of marriage not uncommon among
semi-civilized peoples, as the Nairs of Malabar, the
Kandyans of Ceylon and the Tibetans.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>The Nairs are especially interesting because there
is among them a regulated system of complex
marriage which will compare in its results very
favourably with the monogamous marriage of
Western nations. The rule of the Matriarchate prevails,
“inheritance is from mother to daughter and
from the uncle to the children of the eldest sister;
the household is directed by the mother or the eldest
girl; polyandry and polygamy exist side by side
or are inextricably mixed. Thus each woman is the
wife of several men, each of whom has in turn
several wives.” (Elisee Reclus, <cite>Primitive Folk</cite>,
p. 162.) The men are under well-understood
obligations to assist in the support of the domestic
establishments, while the children look up to their
mothers and uncles as their special protectors.
The result of these customs on the status of women
is most remarkable. It is said that “in no country
are women more influential and respected than in
Malabar.” (Ibid. p. 156.) The Nair lady may
possess property, choose her own husbands and rule
her own children. Marriage is not, as elsewhere, the
taking possession of a woman by the man, but is
really her emancipation from male thraldom. It
puts her as nearly on a footing of social equality
with the man as is possible in a semi-militant community.
What is it that has decided the selection
or unconscious choice—if we may call it so—of
matrimonial usage among the various races of mankind,
since no special form is necessarily connected
with the degree of general civilization? The conditions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>and exigencies of social life; and as those
conditions and exigencies change in the future,
matrimonial usages will also change. As a matter
of fact, every possible method, speaking generally,
has been adopted. Sometimes a regulated promiscuity—for
each man claimed his rights—sometimes
the mixed polyandric and polygamic household;
occasionally simple polyandry or polygamy; at
other times monogamy; marriage experimental also,
as with the Redskins of Canada, who pair and unite
for a few days, then quit each other if the trial has
not proved satisfactory to both parties; or temporary
marriage as in the case of the Jews in Morocco,
who unite for three or six months according to
agreement; or free marriages as those of the Hottentots
and Abyssinians, who marry, part, and remarry
at will; or partial, as the marriages of the
Assanyeh Arabs, which only bind the parties for
certain days of the week. Every possible general
method, I repeat, has been tried, and when the
practice hit upon has served human needs and also
promoted the solidarity and increase of the group,
it has tended to persist.</p>

<p class='c004'>In tracing the evolution of the modern European
form of monogamous marriage, we become aware
that at a very early period, and for a long time subsequently,
the wife was regarded as the absolute
property of the husband. The wife was a bought
or a captured article, and like other articles of property
was at the entire disposal of the owner to use,
sell, lend or abuse as he thought fit. The Roman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>law makes no essential difference between the
marital law and the law of property, and modern
marriage laws in the different States of Europe and
America treat the wife as if she were in a very large
degree a personal possession of her husband.</p>

<p class='c004'>The history of modern marriage, in short, is the
history of man’s domination of woman and the
measures he has taken to assume, assert and establish
his rights of possession. Amid changing outward
conditions of life, he has made good his claim to
control her destiny in accordance with his own
varying desires.</p>

<p class='c004'>In appraising the value of our much-vaunted
monogamy, we must clearly understand that its
legal basis is not, and never was, a strong personal
adhesion of sympathy and affection, but a compact
respecting personal property, involving in the cases
where the “contracting parties are possessed of
wealth, both property in person and in things.” It
is quite legal, and indeed quite respectable, for marriages
to be formed on a pecuniary and social
foundation, into which love does not enter. The
woman who sells herself in marriage to a man for the
sake of money and position is not regarded as a
prostitute, but as a respectable, “honest” woman
who has made a “fortunate” marriage.</p>

<p class='c004'>To understand how thoroughly marriage is based
upon property and not upon love, it should suffice
to contemplate the grounds on which legal divorce
is granted. Divorce is not granted, in this country
at least, on proofs of incompatibility of nature and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>absence of affection, but on proof of adultery, in
which co-respondents may be compelled to pecuniarily
compensate the husband on account of having
made use of his wife without his permission as her
owner. Connivance by the husband precludes the
granting of a divorce. Man’s supremacy and
woman’s subjection become evident in the fact that
no amount of simple adultery in a husband can be
made the ground of a divorce, nor is a wife able to
claim any pecuniary compensation from the paramours
of a husband. Matrimony, at this epoch, is
for the most part a “commercial transaction,” but
in the words of Herbert Spencer, “already increased
facilities for obtaining divorce point to the probability
that whereas in those early stages during
which permanent monogamy was being evolved,
the union by law (originally the act of purchase)
was regarded as the essential part of marriage and
the union by affection non-essential; and whereas
at present the union by law is thought the more
important and the union by affection the less
important, there will come a time when the union by
affection will be held of primary moment, and the
union by law as of secondary moment; and hence
reprobation of marital relations in which the union
by affection has dissolved. That this conclusion
will seem unacceptable to most is probable, I
may say certain.” (<cite>Principles of Sociology</cite>, vol. i.
p. 788.)</p>

<p class='c004'>Herbert Spencer strikes here at the very foundation
of modern marriage. Moreover, in making
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>affection rule sexual relations, he opens up all the
possibilities of other forms of marriage than the
monogamous, for affection may not only be transitory,
but unrestricted to one. In face of the barbarous
origin of marriage, there exists no reason
why people of liberal thought should make a dogged,
pious stand at monogamy while lightly dismissing
promiscuity, polygamy, polyandry as disreputable
forms of sex-union. Mr. Spencer holds that “the
monogamic form of the sexual relation is manifestly
the ultimate form,” but he gives no reasons to prove
his case that are not sufficiently disproved by the
form of marriage existing among the Nairs. Again,
the fact of the numerical equality of the sexes does
not make monogamy the only suitable form, although
it supplies a reasonable objection to pure polygamy
and pure polyandry. Mr. Spencer says that
“monogamy is a pre-requisite to a high position of
women.” Here he plainly overlooks the facts of
the respected and comparatively independent position
of women among peoples practising mixed
polygamy and polyandry under fixed rules and regulations.</p>

<p class='c004'>With the actual facts of life before us, we are
forced to admit that under the régime of man’s
dominancy and woman’s subjection, monogamy has
been gross throughout all history, while with polyandry
it has not been so. Note, in this regard, one
fact alone—jealousy, that mean, selfish emotion
which destroys the happiness of so many lives, is not
in evidence among the simple polyandric Nairs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>The associated husbands live on a good understanding
with one another, there is a complete absence of
jealousy. Which of us can say, in view of the monogamy
that surrounds us: Tolstoi’s graphic picture,
“the wild beast of jealousy began to roar in its den,”
applies only to a marriage in fiction? It is to
monogamy that we owe the typical domestic tyrant
and many tyrannous attributes that survive in
modern masculine human nature. Monogamy, too,
has always been accompanied by other sexual relations
in which both sexes are degraded and one sex
is socially and physically ruined. As Mr. W. E. H.
Lecky has pointed out, monogamy on one side of
the shield implies prostitution on the other.</p>

<p class='c004'>In its normal form, monogamy signifies the
attachment of one man to one woman, involving—first,
permanent and exclusive sexual union;
second, conjoint domestic life; third, the generating
and rearing of a family; fourth, social intercourse
in the class of society to which the parties belong.
Beyond these features of marriage, the economic
and social forces of the age bring about in the vast
majority of marriages a constant subjection of the
wife to the husband, by reason of her being dependent
on him for her living, and a general freedom to
the husband but not to the wife to commit adultery.
There is usually compelled also lateness of marriage,
which implies unhealthful, painful conditions of life
in the celibate youth of both sexes. I will ask here:
Ought we to look upon permanency and exclusiveness
as essential elements in the form of sex-union best
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>suited to humanity at the present stage of its
evolving civilization? Permanency is necessarily
essential to our ideal of the final form of marriage,
for the strongest, most valuable bond of affection
implies it, and loss of love from whatever cause is a
real calamity. But where that calamity has already
befallen, for society to enforce a mere outward
permanency of the matrimonial bond is irrational—the
counterfeit union is productive only of private
misery and public disorder. And further, under our
present wretched economic conditions, the struggle
for bread and absence of leisure and freedom in the
case of the workers, and, amid the upper classes,
frequent financial difficulties, false notions and customs
of propriety and etiquette—all these combine
to make it rare indeed that a man or woman chances
to meet and unite with his or her counterpart or true
life companion.</p>

<p class='c004'>Commercialism is no safe guide in the quest for a
vital, permanent sex-union, and until commercialism
wholly disappears, the exigencies of life demand
freedom of divorce to rectify unavoidable errors of
judgment in matrimony, and make more possible the
forming of ties that are truly and naturally permanent.</p>

<p class='c004'>As human beings become more moral inwardly
and create the outward conditions in which they can
live a truly moral existence, Mr. Emerson’s principle
that the great essentials in human conduct are to
escape from all false ties and to reveal ourselves as
we are, will be more and more acknowledged and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>acted upon. Great thinkers like Milton in the past
and Herbert Spencer in the present, condemn as
contrary to religion and reason a permanency that
involves falsity or absence of love. “It is a less
breach of wedlock,” says Milton, “to part with
wise and quiet consent betimes, than still to foil and
profane that mystery of joy and union with a
polluting sadness and perpetual distemper; for it
is not the outward continuing of marriage that keeps
whole that covenant, but whatsoever does most
according to peace and love, whether in marriage or
in divorce, he it is that breaks marriage least, it
being so often written that ‘Love only is the fulfilment
of every commandment.’” (John Milton, <cite>The
Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce</cite>, chap. v.) Divorce
made attainable to all men and women, rich and
poor, without any disgraceful accompaniment, is a
necessary condition of progress. And in effect, each
nation of Western Europe accepts and facilitates
divorce concurrently with its advance in civilization.</p>

<p class='c004'>Not long ago, in my hearing, a Roman Catholic
barrister, whose practice makes him familiar with all
that occurs in the Divorce Court, delivered himself
to this effect: “My church anathematises divorce,
and to my mind she is right. But I am not the fool
to think that the divorce law passed in our Statute
Books in the year 1858 will ever be annulled or
departed from. In the interests of morality, the
pressing desideratum is that the basis of divorce be
made the same for man and woman. It is a crying
iniquity that whereas a husband by avoiding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>physical force, may legally be as unfaithful to his
marriage vows as he chooses, and may tyrannize
over and trample under his feet the feelings of his
wife, one single slip in an unguarded moment on her
part, one act of adultery committed, it may be in
a fit of despair, entitles him by law to repudiate her
summarily as barbarian husbands dismissed their
wives.”</p>

<p class='c004'>While permanency is eminently valuable in sexual
relations, can we venture to say the same as regards
exclusiveness? This distinctive quality of exclusiveness
is not an extension of love, but a narrowing
of it down—a restraint upon personal feeling. When
woman wins her freedom and is no longer under any
circumstances man’s dependent and slave, but his
friend and comrade in the battle of life, will she
restrain the physical expression of sex-love, yet
fearlessly respond to all the tender ties certain to
unite her with the opposite sex? To give at present
a dogmatic reply is impossible. Personally, my
instincts—so far as I know them—accord with
Herbert Spencer’s dictum: the ultimate form of
sexual relation will be monogamic; but I recognize
my own limitations. Since the women of my
generation are children of bond-slaves, hampered
within and without by survivals from an epoch of
sex subjection wherein man’s dominancy superimposed
upon woman a chastity he repudiated for
himself, the standpoint from which the freed being
of the future will decide her sex-morality is not in
the grasp of my apprehension.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>Nevertheless, the immediate path of progress is
distinctly marked out. I agree with the author who
holds the opinion that: “Better indeed were a
Saturnalia of <em>free</em> men and women than the spectacle
which, as it is, our great cities present at night.”
(Edward Carpenter.) But set women free “from
the mere cash-nexus to a husband, from the money
slavery of the streets, from the nameless terrors of
social opinion, and from the threats of the choice of
perpetual virginity or perpetual bondage,” and we
need not fear for sex-morality. “Sex in man is an
organized passion, an individual need or impetus;
but in woman it may more properly be termed a
constructive instinct, with the larger signification
that that involves.... Nor does she often experience
that divorce between the sentiment of love and
the physical passion which is so common with men.
Sex with her is a deep and sacred instinct, carrying
with it a sense of natural purity.” (<cite>Woman</cite>, Edward
Carpenter, p. 9.) And from woman herself let me
quote a passage occurring in a women’s journal:
“Love is an emotion separate from sex-impulse, it
may or may not exist in co-relation to it. The
testimony easily taken from the lives of many
women is to the effect that love enters not into the
impulse which, active and unrestrained on the part
of those to whom they are yoked for life, has created
for them a life which can be called by no name save
slavery.” (<cite>Shafts</cite>, October, 1895.) Again, turning
to the opposite sex, Havelock Ellis states (in his
study of <cite>Man and Woman</cite>, Contemporary Science
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>Series) that: “In women men find beings who have
not wandered so far as men from the typical life of
earth’s creatures; women are for men the human
embodiments of the restful responsiveness of Nature.”</p>

<p class='c004'>I am convinced that however polygamous the
male-sex—under a system of industrial commercialism
may appear—the great mass of our women are
not licentious and not polyandrous in tendency. While
a Saturnalia of free men and women would, as compared
with present sexual conditions, be a preferable
evil, we need not in our forecast of the future dread
such a Saturnalia, or face its possibility. It is a
libel on humanity to assume that no self-restraints
are inherent to withhold mankind from sexual
excesses when freed from control by Church and
State. And although it might be said that “the
growing complexity of man’s nature would be likely
to lead him into more rather than fewer sex relations,
on the other hand it is obvious that as the depth
and subtlety of any attachment that really holds
him increases, so does such attachment become
more permanent and durable and less likely to be
realized in a number of persons.... In man and
woman we find a distinct tendency towards the
formation of this double unit of wedded life&#160;... and
while we do not want to stamp such natural unions
with any false irrevocability or dogmatic exclusiveness,
what we do want is a recognition to-day of the
tendency to their formation as a natural fact independent
of any artificial laws.” (<cite>Marriage</cite>, Edward
Carpenter, p. 31.)</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>The natural restraints or checks upon undue
indulgence in sex-intercourse extend from the physical
or material plane to the spiritual plane. These
are—considerations of health; feelings of unselfishness
and social duty; and a spiritual, i.e. an ideal,
conception of humanity and of all the manifold
relations of life.</p>

<p class='c004'>Unselfishness is pre-eminently the natural check
and regulator of sex relations, and not until love is
emancipated from selfishness will it reach an ideal
form. If we love unselfishly we desire the happiness
and freedom of the being loved even to the extent
of self-abnegation; tyranny and jealousy become
impossible. All natural checks will necessarily
strengthen and grow as humanity rises higher in the
scale of being; moreover, education is bound—under
racial progress—to become to each succeeding
generation a much more adequate guide than hitherto.
Even in the present day, it would not be difficult to
get youths and girls at the age of romance to understand
that “though they may have to contend with
some superfluity of passion in early years, the most
permanent and deeply-rooted desire within them
will, in all probability, lead them at last to find their
complete happiness and self-fulfilment only in a close
union with a life-mate”; to understand also that
“towards this end they must be prepared to use
self-control, to prevent the aimless straying of their
passions, and patience and tenderness towards the
realization of the union when its time comes.”
(Edward Carpenter.) This teaching would bring to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>the young a far truer conception of the sacredness
of marriage than our marriage laws and customs
give.</p>

<p class='c004'>It must never be forgotten, however, that this
question of marriage and every other social question
must be viewed in relation to kindred topics. A
sectional treatment of society will surely mislead if
we fail to recall the changes going forward in every
department of life, and the close connexion that
exists between the forces of social and individual
evolution. Scientific meliorism implies a reconstruction
of domestic life; and, within the new
environment, the instructing of youth and its guidance
in sex-conduct will become comparatively easy.
Nor is it only by the training and guidance of youth
that marriage will be favourably affected in a new
domestic system. The tendency to tyranny within
the home—an abhorrent feature of past monogamy—will
have no opportunity to appear; and two
undesirable female types—the idle fine lady and the
household drudge—will become as extinct as the
dodo.</p>

<p class='c004'>Outside the precincts of home, large social and
industrial changes will promote the disappearance
of the prostitute, and finally there will emerge the
truly emancipated woman, fearless and enlightened—a
capable guide to man in the task of consciously
subordinating passions that are selfish and transitory
to those deeper attachments and higher emotions
that give birth to spiritual love. “Is marriage a
failure?” has been boldly asked and widely discussed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>in comparatively recent years; and that the
audible answer—sadly re-echoed in thousands of
hearts—was in the affirmative, shows a wholesome
awakening to facts—an awakening that inevitably
precedes all real reforms in an epoch of conscious
evolution.</p>

<p class='c004'>So permeated with selfishness is the mental
atmosphere surrounding all questions of sex that the
rule of life I here indicate will be utterly distasteful
to those who accept the régime of custom. Yet
as regards morality or an ethical code, there are two,
and two only, logical attitudes of mind. Either we
must think of the stamping out of all sexual feeling
on the ground of its purely animal nature, and limiting
physical union to the utmost that is compatible
with perpetuation of species; or we must think of a
gradual elevating of sexual instinct and action to a
dignified position in human life with due consideration
for the desires and needs of every one after
puberty is reached. The first is practically impossible
to the vast majority of the race at its present
stage of development. They would simply refuse
submission to the intolerable restraints necessitated.
In effect, the ascetic answer to problems of sex is
no actual solution, but a shelving of the fundamental
question, with a tacit acceptance of the prodigious
evils around us in respect both of sex-union and the
advent of children. The only rational course is that
of elevating and regulating these relations in view
of human happiness. This implies a steady repression
of anti-social emotions and persistent cultivation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>of unselfishness. Our marital habits of selfish
appropriation and jealous control are in direct
opposition to the moral elevation of sexual instinct.
Selfishness degrades where it penetrates, and the
problem is to rescue our sexual forces from selfishness,
and utilize these forces, i.e. make them subserve
the interests of social virtue. Hitherto, they have
been ignored and neglected—a result of false thinking
and ascetic teaching, while in actual life they
have run riot, creating incalculable evils.</p>

<p class='c004'>The British race publicly professes monogamy
and preaches to the young a Puritan doctrine.
Privately the drama enacted would disgrace a
civilization of the Middle Ages. In the lower classes
wife-beating and murder, in the upper classes the
hideous revelations of the Divorce Court, witness to
the impurity and the misery of our boasted monogamy.
We tolerate licence, we condemn and conceal
vicious propensities; we harbour a social evil
of gigantic magnitude, we permit hypocrisy to prevail,
we instigate the young to form self-interested
mercantile marriages. We are corrupt in our social
life and mentally debased, for we refuse to think out
a rational code of sex morals, and without that we
shall never attain to a lofty conception, a true ideal
of what life ought to be. Our modern monogamy
in its inwardness is not falsely pictured in this
indictment: “The commercialism which buys and
sells all human things; the narrow physical passion
of jealousy; the petty sense of private property in
another person; social opinions and legal enactments,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>have all converged to choke and suffocate
wedded love in egoism, lust and meanness.”
(Edward Carpenter’s <cite>Marriage</cite>, p. 38.)</p>

<p class='c004'>In view of general happiness and virtue, we must
seek the abrogation of all laws based on or involving
sex-inequality. And, further, that marriage may
become transformed into a sacred, sympathetic and
permanent bond—a deeper and truer relation of
life—we must seek facilities for divorce or the abrogation
of the specific law that binds beings together
for life in ill-assorted or artificial unions.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>The simple fact that the birth of a human being, the
image of God, as religious people say, is in so many cases
regarded as of very much less importance than that of
a domestic animal, proves the degraded condition in which
we live.—<span class='sc'>August Bebel.</span></p>

<p class='c008'>The reproduction of species yields to no other
special function of life in respect of importance
and the wide scope of its vital issues. Notwithstanding
that vast numbers of illegitimate children
are born in every civilized country where monogamy
reigns, this function of reproduction is popularly
regarded as allied with marriage in the order of
a natural and necessary consequence—a result
irrespective of human will. Now scientific meliorism
makes a clear distinction between marriage and
parentage on the ground that, while the former
comparatively is of insignificant importance to
the interests of humanity in general, parentage
is of vital moment to these interests; moreover,
between the two there exists no integral or essential
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>relation. On the one hand, progeny spring from
unions not legalized by marriage; on the other,
many married people, swayed by motives chiefly
egoistic, but sometimes altruistic, are consciously
exercising a voluntary restraint over propagation.</p>

<p class='c004'>The late Matthew Arnold tells us that when
gazing on one occasion in company with a benevolent
man upon a multitude of slum children eaten
up with disease, half-sized, half-fed, half-clothed,
neglected by their parents, without health, without
home, without hope, the good man said: “The
one thing really needful is to teach these little
ones to succour one another, if only with a cup of
cold water.” Mr. Arnold promptly rejected that
theory. “So long as the multitude of these poor
children is perpetually swelling,” said he, “they
must be charged with misery to themselves and
us, whether they help one another with a cup of
cold water or no, and the knowledge how to prevent
them accumulating is what we want.” That
knowledge is no longer inaccessible to man. There
are known rational methods by which to keep the
populating tendency within due limits, and at the
same time to promote individual prudence, foresight
and self-dependence.</p>

<p class='c004'>Neo-Malthusianism, with its power of subjugating
the law of population and deferring parentage,
is a new key to the social position, and neo-Malthusian
practice has already taken root in
British society. The discovery is of vast significance,
so great are its latent possibilities of promoting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>universal happiness. But as long as reproduction
of human physical life is left to haphazard,
and the rule of private, personal interests alone,
without any honourable recognition, intelligent
guidance, or moral and economic support, the
immediate effect on national life is, and will continue
to be, the very reverse of beneficial.</p>

<p class='c004'>Matthew Arnold’s exhortation in respect of
the slum children was: “We must let conscience
play freely and simply upon the facts of the case;
we must listen to what it tells us of the intelligible
law of things as concerns these children, and what
it tells us is that a man’s children are not really
sent any more than the pictures upon his walls
or the horses in his stable are sent, and that to
bring people into the world when one cannot afford
to keep them and oneself decently, or to bring
more of them into the world than one can afford
to keep thus, is by no means an accomplishment
of the Divine Will or a fulfilment of nature’s simplest
laws, but is contrary to reason and the will
of God.” (<cite>Culture and Anarchy</cite>, p. 246.)</p>

<p class='c004'>This remonstrance addressed to the rich (these
alone have pictures on their walls and horses in
their stables) may have had some effect, for certain
it is that in the upper classes artificial checks to
conception are now widely used, while slum children
show no tendency to proportionately diminish
in number. Individuals whose standard of living
is high, and whose pecuniary means are small,
or who are thoughtful, intelligent, prudent, either
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>refrain from marriage, or, marrying, check propagation.
The natural result is that children of the
comparatively superior types are becoming
numerically weaker than children of the thoughtless,
reckless members of society who exercise
their reproductive powers to the utmost. It is
supremely important that we should recognize
how parentage bears upon human life and happiness
in far wider relations than either sexual union
alone or marriage alone.</p>

<p class='c004'>Maintenance of species has hitherto been accomplished
at an enormous sacrifice of individual life.
The requirement that there shall arise a full number
of adults in successive generations is fulfilled by
means which subordinate the existing and next
succeeding members of the species in various
degrees. (See Herbert Spencer’s <cite>Principles of
Sociology</cite>, vol. i. p. 621.)</p>

<p class='c004'>Among low forms—inferior to the human organism—the
germs of new individuals are produced
in immense numbers, the larger part of
the parental substance being sometimes transformed
into these germs. Birth here may be
immediately followed by the death of the parent
organism, and an immense mortality of the young
may take place—consequent on defenceless exposure,
insufficient food and other untoward conditions.
“Of a million minute ova left uncared
for, the majority are destroyed before they are
hatched, so that very few have considerable amounts
of individual life.” (Ibid. p. 622.)</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>Throughout the course of evolution the natural
order in moving from higher to higher types is
a gradual decrease of this condition, viz. the sacrifice
of individual life to the life of the species, and
at the same time an increase of compensating
pleasures allied with the reproductive function.
When illustrating this natural order, Herbert
Spencer points to the methods among fishes and
amphibians contrasted with those among birds
and mammals. The spawn of the former when
safely deposited is generally left to its fate.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c015'><sup>[3]</sup></a> There
is physical cost to adults with apparently no accompanying
gratifications. Birds and mammals, however,
carefully rear and tend their offspring. “The
activities of parenthood are sources of agreeable
emotions, just as are the activities which achieve
self-sustentation.”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c004'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. There are exceptions to the rule, as in the case of the
male stickleback.</p>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Passing from the less intelligent vertebrates
which produce many young at short intervals
and abandon them at an early age, to the more
intelligent higher vertebrates which produce few
young at longer intervals and aid them for longer
periods, this principle clearly emerges—“While
the rate of juvenile mortality is diminished, there
results both a lessened physical cost of maintaining
the species and an augmented satisfaction of the
affections.” (<cite>Principles of Sociology</cite>, vol. i. p. 628.)</p>

<p class='c004'>There is no reversal of this genetic order of nature
in the epoch of conscious evolution. The processes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>are different, because man possesses developed
intellect, aided by scientific knowledge and invention
as a new and skilled ally in the struggle
to maintain his species at less and less cost of
individual life and happiness; but the general
forward movement takes precisely the same course.
With the highest evolved type of man this sacrifice
of individual life to the species is reduced to
a minimum, while the interests of species are conserved
in a painless, a wholly superior manner.
And, further, the entire range of domestic feelings—parental,
filial, fraternal and intimately social,
become extended and increasingly capable of
bestowing enduring pleasure. The ultimate goal
is easy maintenance of species, without—to any
unpleasurable extent—subordinating single members
of species to that end.</p>

<p class='c004'>Love of offspring, as already explained, has
no reproductive instinct at its base. It is a feeling—superimposed
on organic nature—dependent on
family life or arrangements that involve parental
care and more or less of adult activity directed to
the well-being of the young. This sentiment of
love of offspring or philoprogenitiveness, is well
established in the British race; but with rampant
poverty in our midst, can we wonder that in
hundreds of thousands of individual cases the
paternal relation—so capable of filling the heart
with tender emotions and joy—creates an actual
disgust, or a feeling of despair, malignancy, even
injustice, as is shown in the touching little satire,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span><cite>Ginx’s Baby</cite>. Ginx frankly gave his wife
notice that, as his utmost efforts could scarcely
maintain their existing family, if she ventured
to present him with any more, either single or
twins&#160;... “he would most assuredly drown him.”
Later, when the arrival of number thirteen is
imminent—the wife being unable longer to hide
the impending event—Ginx fixed his determination
by much thought and a little extra drinking. He
argued thus: “He wouldn’t go on the parish. He
couldn’t keep another youngster to save his life.
He had never taken charity and never would.
There was nothink to do with it but drown it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Nor is even the maternal relation proof against
bitterness in untoward conditions, although the
feelings will be differently expressed, and may
possibly assume a pious garb. “I’ve ’ad my
fifteen or my twenty on ’em, but, thank ’eaven,
the churchyard ’as stood my friend.” These or
similar words have often been heard in an English
factory town. The women speaking thus were
not otherwise callous or incapable of mother-love.
They were gentle, patient, toiling drudges, who
had had the philoprogenitiveness of average
human nature and the tender joys of maternity
perverted into secret care and open hypocritical
cant by the physical strain of a too-frequent child-bearing,
combined with the miseries of ceaseless
labour, pinched means, and comfortless, crowded
homes.</p>

<p class='c004'>The frequent advent of children who are unwelcome
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>to their own parents in a society no longer
ignorant of the scientific means by which its weakest
members may avoid parentage, without any destruction
of life or any injury to sexual function,
is marvellously irrational, and it indicates divergence
from the well-marked path of evolutional
progress.</p>

<p class='c004'>Opposition to neo-Malthusian practice arises
from primitive conceptions of life (conceptions
antecedent to evolutional theory), while all the
various undefined scruples painfully experienced
by individuals are survivals of the sentiment
allied with these false conceptions. Prejudice
dies slowly, as ignorance is dispelled by the
growing light of new knowledge.</p>

<p class='c004'>I have shown that asceticism is an immoral
principle, the action of which tends to fill individual
life with gloom and depression, and to thwart or
counteract general happiness. I have also shown
the absolute necessity for retarding the multiplication
of human beings to suit the limits of
available subsistence. And now, after pointing
out that philoprogenitiveness—which is the groundwork
of domestic and social virtue, and ought to
be the mainspring of reproduction of species—is
continually liable to be strained, depressed or
perverted into anti-social bitterness in parental
bosoms among the lower classes, I must ask the
question: How otherwise than by the easiest
method known to science could the difficulties of
the position be met and overcome?</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>Messrs. Patrick Geddes and J. A. Thomson, in
their treatise on the <cite>Evolution of Sex</cite>, urge the
necessity of what they call “an ethical rather
than a mechanical prudence after marriage, of a
temperance recognized to be as binding on husband
and wife as chastity on the unmarried.” (<cite>The
Evolution of Sex</cite>, p. 297.) But what do these
gentlemen mean by the temperance here recommended?
It is surely well known that the birth
of a large family is perfectly consistent with a
sparing, most temperate exercise of the procreative
function; and surely also it would be folly on our
part to look for parental conduct controlled by
ethical motive in the warrens of the poor of our
large cities, from whence springs an important
section of the national life. (<cite>Social Control of the
Birth Rate</cite>, Pamphlet by G. A. Gaskell.)</p>

<p class='c004'>In the homes of the upper classes, adorned with
all the amenities and refinements of civilization,
parental prudence results mainly from egoistic
motive. Practical reformers will hesitate to
assume that those—the less favoured social units—are
likely to surpass these in moral elevation,
and demean themselves generally in a superior
manner! But further, a parental prudence, dispensing
with mechanical methods of checking
propagation, may even prove the converse of
ethical conduct. Advanced sexual morality requires
a free and healthful exercise of sexual function.
That such freedom is not possible under present
social conditions is irrelevant to the question at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>issue; the point is that conduct unnecessarily
traversing this advanced sexual morality is not
in accordance with rationalized social ethics; it
has no scientific basis.</p>

<p class='c004'>Parental morals must conform to the principle
indicated by Herbert Spencer—reduce to a minimum
the sacrifice of individual life and happiness to
the life of the species; augment to the maximum
the joys of affection involved in parental relations.
This is possible to a race among which are beings
of low intelligence and unrestrained passion only
by bringing into play the laws of heredity through
rational breeding. But rational breeding depends
on an appeal to ordinary egoistic motive and practical
resort to the painless mechanical means of
checking conception.</p>

<p class='c004'>There is no general unwillingness to limit their
families among the poor; what is lacking consists
simply in power of control over the physical conditions
of fertility. To see children half-starved
and wives sickly and miserable is no more pleasant
to parents of the Ginx order than to those of us
who view it from a safe distance; and there is
ample intelligence to perceive the connexion between,
on the one hand, discomfort and poverty
attendant on a family of ten or twelve, on the
other, comparative comfort allied with a family
of only three or four.</p>

<p class='c004'>A code of ethics covering the interests of the
entire nation commands strenuous effort on the
part of all thoughtful, intelligent people to make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>the artificial checks known to the thoughtless and
unintelligent. It is not by proudly rejecting
scientific invention in this matter that we shall
attain to development of higher and higher types
of man, but by skilfully using it as a powerful
ally in our struggle to maintain and regenerate
species at less and less cost to individual happiness.</p>

<p class='c004'>Apart altogether from man’s partial practice
of neo-Malthusian art, under egoistic motives,
civilization has created an interference with the
original order of race preservation under generous
or altruistic motive. Social feeling slowly developing
revolts—in detail—from the cruel method
of the law of natural selection. It spontaneously
supersedes that law by one of sympathetic selection.
But whereas the former law issued in survival
of the fittest, the latter issues day by day in indiscriminate
survival, and consequent race deterioration.
A controlled rate of increase is not therefore
the only position to which reason and science
must guide us; we have further to escape from
the disastrous consequences of the above law and
pass to conditions of life evolved under the benign
influence of a rational and moral law—a law of
social selection, resulting in appropriate birth,
or the birth of the socially fit.</p>

<p class='c004'>There are thousands of our present day population
with whom family life is no whit superior
to that of birds, whose pairing is immediately
followed by rapid breeding and a complete scattering
of the brood when the young are barely fledged.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>A wise philanthropy in line with the march of
progressive evolution may lift these thousands
to the level of the higher vertebrates, “which
produce few young at longer intervals and give
them aid for longer periods.” The recalcitrant
minority refusing to practice parental prudence
must be treated by society as abnormal individuals,
incapable of rising to the standard of average
civilized human nature, and these must be subjected
to social restraint.</p>

  <h3 class='c005'>THE ELIMINATION OF CRIME</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Many a man thinks that it is his goodness which keeps
him from crime, when it is only his full stomach. On half
allowance, he would be as ugly and knavish as anybody.
Don’t mistake potatoes for principles.—<span class='sc'>Carlyle.</span></p>

<p class='c008'>A normal child of five years once asked the meaning
of this expression—“hanging a murderer,”
and after explanation said eagerly, “But will
hanging the man make that other man alive
again?” On receiving a negative reply, the remonstrance
burst forth, “Then why kill him,
since when he is dead we can never make him
good again?”</p>

<p class='c004'>This is a true picture of the thinking and feeling
about crime which is natural to the best types of
our present-day humanity. These demand that
our punishments shall either reform the criminal
or protect society effectively from his malfeasance.
As a matter of fact, our criminal code and whole
machinery and procedure relative to crime accomplish
neither, and this is freely admitted by men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>whose position enables them to judge accurately
and entitles them to express an opinion.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Justice Matthew has said at the Birmingham
Assizes that the present state of the criminal law
is a hundred years behind the times. Sir Edmund
Du Cane, Chairman of the Directors of Convict
Prisons, says of the solitary system practised in
our penal prisons: “It is an artificial state of
existence, absolutely opposed to that which nature
points out as the condition of mental, moral and
physical health.... The minds of the prisoners
become enfeebled by long-continued isolation.”
In the Official Report of the Departmental Committee
on Prisons, 1895, these words occur: “The
prisoners have been treated too much as a hopeless
or worthless part of the community. The moral
condition in which a large number of prisoners
leave the prison, and the serious number of recommittals,
have led us to think there is ample
cause for a searching inquiry into the main features
of prison life.” The late Judge Fitz-Stephen
published his <cite>History of the Criminal Law</cite> in 1883,
and pointed there to “notorious evils of which
it is difficult,” said he, “to find a satisfactory
remedy.” Nevertheless, he put down his finger
on the crucial spot when he wrote “the law proceeds
upon the principle that it is morally right
to hate criminals. It confirms and justifies that
sentiment by inflicting upon criminals punishment
which expresses it.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But it is not right to hate criminals. It is morally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>wrong, i.e. it is contrary to these laws of nature,
by which alone an elevated and happy social life
may be attained. The emotion of hatred creates
vibrations producing evil on the moral plane, as
certainly as discordant sounds, acting on sensitive
ears, produce discomfort; and, if persisted in,
produce organic disorganization on the physical
plane. Hence, all punishment or legal procedure
directed against crime, having hatred at its foundation,
or historic base, must fail. On the negative
side, hatred has proved ineffectual in protecting
society from crime. On the positive side, it increases
the anti-social feelings, whose natural
outcome is crime, and frustrates, or annuls, the
human forces of love, which already widely existent,
and swaying humanity’s best types, are the true
evolutional factors by which to annihilate crime.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Justice Matthew was simply asserting a
fact of social science when he stated that the
criminal law is out of date. It consists with a
primitive stage of social life; but it is totally inconsistent
with even the semi-civilization of to-day.
The fundamental discord between our action and
feeling relative to crime declares itself in the uncertainty
of a criminal’s fate and the steady survival
of his type. But, my reader, while accepting
Justice Matthew’s premise, may doubt the conclusion
at which Judge Fitz-Stephen arrived—that
vindictiveness or hate lies at the root of our
criminal code, and that our punishments express
it. Moreover, he may condemn by anticipation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>a supposed tendency on my part to censure all
punishments, and rely solely on a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laissez-faire</span></i>
system of dealing with crime. Scientific meliorism,
however, does not imply anarchy or the absence
of governing law. Its methods repudiate the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laissez-faire</span></i> principle in every department of life,
for this reason: Our developed faculties and accumulated
knowledge make untenable the negative
or inert position. We are impelled in an epoch
of conscious evolution to take positive action
favourable to progress.</p>

<p class='c004'>My contention is this: love of all men, not hatred
of any man or class of men ought to be the basis
of our criminal code. Modern science, experience
and skill are competent to redeem the criminal
class, speaking generally, and in exceptional cases,
where redemption is impossible, can render the
criminal innocuous to society, while giving him
throughout life such innocent happiness as a being
organically defective may enjoy.</p>

<p class='c004'>This thesis embraces a very wide range of action.
It means the systematic rational treatment of
evil-doers, from the refractory infant and juvenile
pickpocket to the burglar, the fraudulent bankrupt,
the felon, the traitor, the murderer, and if any
exist, the born criminal. It signifies, in short,
a complete science complementary to that of true
education. For whereas the latter comprises all
manner of attractive stimuli to noble living, this
is the science of necessary social restraints
to be applied in nursery, school and prison with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>the universal gentleness which springs from universal
love. The purpose to be aimed at is, first,
improving character by restraining obnoxious tendencies;
second, reforming character already
become anti-social; third, protecting society from
all corrupt infusion that might proceed from
morally diseased character.</p>

<p class='c004'>A leading principle of the criminal law of Great
Britain is that punishment be adjusted in proportion
to the supposed magnitude of each individual
offence. If we study this principle, we
must perceive the truth of Judge Fitz-Stephen’s
allegation, for what connexion has it with the
reformation of the criminal? A judge or a jury
makes no attempt to compute the amount of prison
restraint and discipline necessary to reformation,
nor are they possessed of facts for forming a judgment.
Their whole attention has been focussed
on the crime, not on the character of the criminal,
or the antecedent and future conditions affecting
the character. Neither does the judicial sentence
connect itself proportionately with the mischief
done to society. A fraudulent banker or commercial
speculator, whose downfall involves the
ruin of thousands, is not dealt with, as compared
with a petty thief, on a scale of severity expressive
of the magnitude of suffering entailed. And the
petty thief, who steals the rich man’s goods, as
compared with the criminal who beats and abuses
his wife, is adjudged a severer penalty—a measure
of punishment indicating the superior value of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>goods over wives, which is a sentiment appropriate
only to barbarous times.</p>

<p class='c004'>These anomalies, however, are explainable. Our
laws have descended to us from a barbarous age,
when might was right, irrespective of justice;
and from a race whose punishments sprang from
revenge, and were roughly proportioned to the
feeling of revenge. They are little else than reactionary
forces, of which some are always present
in an inchoate society. Their inapplicability
to the task of reforming criminals is easily
proved.</p>

<p class='c004'>In Scotland in a single year not fewer than “six
hundred and ninety persons were committed to
prison who had been in confinement at least ten
times before. Of these, three hundred and ninety-three
had been in prison at least twenty times
before, and twenty-three at least fifty times!”
(<cite>Hill on Crime</cite>, p. 28.) These figures speak for
themselves. Our whole system is glaringly unscientific.
We do not remove the conditions that
act as causes of crime. We punish, and sometimes
severely, yet we let loose again offenders not one
whit more prepared than before to withstand the
temptations of freedom. We calmly support and
approve an enormous expenditure of public funds
upon criminals and crime; we carefully select
good men to be prison managers, officers and chaplains;
we secure cleanliness and sanitation within
the prisons, and so forth; but these efforts are
utterly futile because the system is wrong—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>criminal law of Great Britain is based upon a false,
an irrational principle.</p>

<p class='c004'>The causes of crime within our province to deal
with are of a two-fold nature—objective and subjective.
Poverty, i.e. hunger and want, a slum
environment, rough handling in infancy and childhood,
a mischievous training and the absence of all
conditions favourable to gentle, virtuous life—these
are some of the objective causes creating
crime which society is bound to remove. Among
causes deciding the innate character of every
newly-born babe, the forces of heredity stand out
conspicuously. I have demonstrated that aggregate
humanity, in a scientific age, has the means of
controlling these forces and directing them to the
production of physical, mental and moral health
in the individual, and consequently in the community.
The born criminal type may become
gradually improved by careful and wise treatment
under life-long restraints. Meanwhile, to seek reformation
of this type, by prison discipline alone,
and treat it by methods adapted to corrigible culprits,
is a folly dishonouring to the developed
reason of man. We have abundant evidence that
the type exists. Mr. Frederick Hill, late Inspector
of Prisons, says: “Nothing has been more clearly
shown in the course of my inquiries than that
crime is hereditary to a considerable extent&#160;...
it proceeds from father to son in a long line of succession.”
(<cite>Hill on Crime</cite>, p. 55.) Mr. J. B.
Thomson, Resident Surgeon of the Perth Prison,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>states of the facts of prison life: “They press
on my mind the conviction that crime in general
is a moral disease of a chronic and congenital
nature, intractable when transmitted from generation
to generation.” And Mr. George Combe,
speaking of prisons in the United States of America,
wrote: “I have put the question to many keepers
of prisons whether they believed in the possibility
of reforming all offenders. From those whose
minds were humane and penetrating, I have received
the answer—they did not, for experience
had convinced them that some criminals are incorrigible
by any human means hitherto discovered.
These incorrigibles,” says George Combe—and
this is the point to observe, “were always
found to have defective organizations;&#160;... they
are morally idiotic; and justice, as well as humanity,
dictates our treating them as patients. They
labour under great natural defects;&#160;... to punish
them for actions proceeding from these natural
defects is no more just or beneficial to society than
it would be to punish men for having crooked
spines or club feet.” (George Combe’s <cite>Moral
Philosophy</cite>, p. 306.) And I could refer to many
more authorities on the subject were it necessary.</p>

<p class='c004'>Accepting the theory that our born-criminals
are victims of moral disease, the question arises—how
should we treat them? Fifty years ago we
sorely maltreated our victims to mental disease.
We bound them hand and foot, we punished them
sternly for their congenital defects, we shunned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>and hated them, and because they were martyrs
to a pitiful disease we made them also the victims
of unnecessary and cruel sufferings. Few men
to-day could glance without a shudder at the record
of our treatment of lunatics. We consign the
history gladly to oblivion, and point to changes
betokening the better feeling of to-day. “No
one thinks of sending a madman to a lunatic asylum
for a certain number of days, weeks or months.
We carefully ascertain that he is unfit to be at
large, and that those in whose hands we are about
to place him act under due inspection and have
the knowledge and skill which afford the best hope
for his cure; that they will be kind to him, and
inflict no more pain than is necessary for his secure
custody&#160;... we leave it to them to determine if,
or when, he can be safely liberated.” (<cite>Hill on
Crime</cite>, p. 151.)</p>

<p class='c004'>These are the lines on which also should run
our treatment of moral disease. If a man is unfit
morally to be at large, we must narrow the conditions
of his life, but make it as enjoyable within
the coercive restraints as is compatible with improvement.
And on no account must we restore
his liberty until those who professionally and
officially watch his daily conduct are convinced
that he will not again be likely to abuse that liberty.</p>

<p class='c004'>But apart altogether from individual delinquents,
the subjective racial tendency to crime demands
special treatment, and in this regard I maintain
that the enlightened action of an advanced society
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>will be analogous to the ignorant action of an
earnest church in the Middle Ages with precisely
opposite results. “The long period of the Dark
Ages, under which Europe lay, was due, I believe,
in a very considerable degree,” says Francis Galton,
“to the celibacy enjoined by religious orders on
their votaries. Whenever a man or woman was
possessed of a gentle nature that fitted him or her
to deeds of charity, to meditation, to literature
or to art, the social condition of the time was such
that they had no refuge elsewhere than in the
bosom of the church. But the church preached
and exacted celibacy. The consequence was that
these gentle natures had no continuance, and by
a policy so singularly unwise and suicidal that
I am hardly able to speak of it without impatience,
the church brutalized the breed of our forefathers.
She acted as if she aimed at selecting the rudest
portion of the community to be alone the parents
of future generations. She practised the arts
which breeders would use who aimed at creating
ferocious, currish and stupid natures. No wonder
that club law prevailed for centuries over Europe;
the wonder is, that enough good remained in the
veins of Europeans to enable their race to rise
to its present very moderate level of natural
morality.” (<cite>Hereditary Genius</cite>, F. Galton, p. 356.)</p>

<p class='c004'>A humane society, guided by rational forces
in the epoch of conscious evolution, will practise
the policy of the church of the Middle Ages on a
different class of subjects. It will gather poor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>criminals into its bosom, and secure for them a
safe and happy refuge while exacting celibacy.
The racial blood shall not be poisoned by moral
disease. The guardians of the present-day social
life dare not be careless of future social life and
the happiness of generations unborn; therefore
the criminal breed must be forcibly restrained
from perpetuating its kind. Now mark the result.
Not gentle natures—as in the case of the church—but
the innately vicious natures will have no
continuance. The criminal type slowly but surely
disappears.</p>

<p class='c004'>To promote the contentment and comfort of
congenital criminals within their asylum or prison
home an alternative to celibacy might be offered,
viz. surgical treatment, to render the male incapable
of reproduction. (The treatment indicated is not
the operation ordinarily performed upon some
domestic animals; this, applied to human beings,
would be morally and physically injurious. Particulars
of the appropriate method were published
in the <cite>British Medical Journal</cite> as early as May 2,
1874, at p. 586.) Were this course voluntarily
chosen, the sexes might intermingle without danger
to posterity; and since fuller social life tends to
make all human beings happier, these convicts
would become more manageable, and coercive
restraints cease to be indispensable.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the criminal stock is not great when compared
with the actual crimes of to-day. Crime
in a vast measure is simply produced by the outward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>accidental conditions of life—an evil environment
and a grossly inadequate training.
If we alter the environment of our masses—by
establishing a new industrial system that banishes
poverty from the land, by initiating a Malthusian
and neo-Malthusian practice that puts the physical
life on a healthy basis, by creating a family life
suitable to man’s emotional nature, and supplying
a true education that embraces scientific restraints
on all anti-social tendencies—then, but not till
then, will crime and the criminal type alike become
things of the past.</p>

<p class='c004'>We are surrounded to-day in our reformatories
and board schools, in our homes and on our streets,
by children of naïvely-disobedient or rebellious
tendency. These are the embryo criminals of a
few years hence. When a clever romanticist
makes one his hero, and describes the development
of trickiness in the child, and how he uses
it as a weapon of defence against the “polissman”
whom he defies, trips up and otherwise evades
(<cite>Cleg Kelly</cite>, by Crockett), we read the account
without compunction, nay, we relish the humour
of the situation, and half approve the issue! Yet
this assuredly is no legitimate outcome of childish
bravery and sportiveness. Our levity arises from
the underlying conviction, or the universal feeling
begotten of genetic evolution, that the policeman’s
jurisdiction here is flagrantly inappropriate.</p>

<p class='c004'>Infantile disobedience and full-fledged crime
seem far apart, but they are united by an inward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>deteriorating process, an outward chain of trespasses
more or less petty. The links are all there,
connecting the tender babe and fascinating street-arab
with the thief and murderer. Similarly,
on the moral plane, flow the sequences of cause
and effect that bring retribution—that inalienable
feature of the law of evolution. The crime that
society deplores is the natural penalty for society’s
neglect of children; and there is no escape from
the penalty as long as the cause continues. Nor
can society plead ignorance here. Herbert Spencer
and Ruskin have spoken out plainly on this subject.
“What we need is cessation from all these antagonisms
which keep alive the brutal elements
of human nature, and persistence in a peaceful
life, giving unchequered play to the sympathies.”
(<cite>Herbert Spencer on Arbitration.</cite>) “It is,” says
Ruskin, “the lightest way of killing to stop a man’s
breath. But if you bind up his thoughts by lack
of true education, if you blind his eyes, if you blunt
his hopes, if you steal his joys, if you stunt his body
and blast his soul&#160;... this you think no sin!”
Verily, there <em>is sin</em>, acknowledged by the noblest,
wisest of men, and brought home to us on the lips
of babes—“Why kill the man, since when he is
dead we can never make him good again!”</p>

<p class='c004'>Society has to compass the task of making men
good from the beginning; and in exceptional cases,
where the task is impossible, the victims are simply
society’s patients, to be impounded without hurt.
We are as able to protect our social life from moral
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>as from mental lunatics. The initial step, however
(hardly yet taken), is to pass from the mental
attitude of a barbarous race, whose habits of defence
are those of arbitrary punishment, to that
of a civilized nation bent on reforming its criminals,
and treating its morally diseased members with
uniform humanity and brotherly love. As yet
the resources of man’s reason and scientific knowledge
and aptitude have never been called into
play to devise a system of consecutive restraints
on the “brutal elements,” a system to make men
good from the beginning by “working out the
beast.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The crux of the problem is how to imbue children
painlessly with the truth that social life has
responsibilities and limitations, obedience to which
is indispensable. And I submit that this may be
done in the homes and nurseries of the future,
under a scientifically adapted system of training.
Hard blows and even chiding tones of the human
voice must have no place in childhood’s environment,
but authority may be exercised through
the use of a simple appliance for limiting infant
freedom. When baby trespasses against some
natural law of health or social life, of which he
knows nothing, he is gently but promptly and
firmly placed in a baby-prison standing within
reach, viz. a goodly-sized basket, high at the sides,
softly cushioned all round and weighted, so that
it cannot be overturned by the infant culprit, who,
if refractory, may kick or scream in safety there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>till the paroxysm passes, and he falls asleep. On
waking he recalls vaguely, when older, more clearly
the occurrence, and he becomes lightly possessed
by a subtle sense of authority quite distinct from
individual kindness or unkindness. His human
relations are unhurt by the necessary training in
infancy. He has been checked in wrong-doing
without any wrong association of ideas, and without
an awakening of anti-social feeling.</p>

<p class='c004'>I have seen an ignorant nurse teach a child to
seek solace for pain in an anti-social emotion!
“Beat the naughty chair that has hurt poor baby’s
head,” was the evil counsel, and the child held
out to the chair struck his tiny revengeful blows,
and was kissed and caressed in consequence. This
happened in a rich man’s nursery. Could one
blame the ignorant nurse? Her infancy was
passed in a city slum, and in every such locality
children swarm who freely strike out both in self-protection
and brutal aggressiveness. From birth
these little ones live more or less in an atmosphere
of savage assault. Tyranny and force
are the ruling conditions of their childhood, and
the natural result—under the unalterable law
of cause and effect—is this: vindictive, barbaric
feeling is carried hither and thither throughout
society at large, and degrades every social class.</p>

<p class='c004'>When home-life in the middle classes has been
reorganized, and nursery training is the outcome
of scientific thought, children there at least will
escape this taint. They will pass from nursery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>to schoolroom with nerves that have never been
unnecessarily jarred. They will be physically
stronger, and in temperament more serene. Reared
without harshness, they will know no craven fear;
and since the native attitude of childhood towards
elders never seen angry or cross is that of confiding
love, teachers will have no difficulty in
bringing into play the tender emotions that are
natural checks upon evil doing, and natural incentives
to effort in action that is right. If playfulness
intrudes, and the serious work of a class is hindered
by some little urchin’s fun, the master or mistress
needs neither to scold nor to cane the offender,
for unspoken satisfaction and dissatisfaction are
quickly perceived and responded to by children
unused to punishment or an elder’s frown.</p>

<p class='c004'>But even in the schoolroom an appeal to
mechanism may sometimes prove useful. An
instrument called “a characterograph” was described
by its inventor to an Edinburgh audience
half a century ago. This instrument for registering
had been in use in Lady Byron’s Agricultural
School at Ealing Grove, with moral effects markedly
beneficial. There were many comments in the
press of that period. It supersedes all necessity
for prizes, place-taking, or any kind of reward or
punishment, and renders unnecessary the master’s
expressing anger or irritation—“the worst example
a teacher can set to his pupils.” (Mr. E. T. Craig
was inventor of the characterograph.)</p>

<p class='c004'>If we bear in mind that the supreme object of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>training is <em>social solidarity</em>, and that social solidarity
rests fundamentally on tender relations between
the old, the young, and the middle-aged, we shall
recognize the wisdom of elders resigning at the
earliest possible moment all manifestations of
personal authority. The average boy and girl,
if well trained, has at fifteen, or about that age,
moral powers sufficiently developed to control
innate propensities. At that epoch to the young
themselves should be relegated the ruling of youthful
conduct in the interests of society. Not to the
young singly, however, but in their corporate
capacity. The organizing of juvenile committees
and conduct clubs will ensue. I need not, however,
treat of these here. They belong to the
subject of general education, and I am merely
touching on training in its relations to specific crime.</p>

<p class='c004'>The point in social science to emphasize is this:
At every stage of the nation’s history its moral
health or disease is the actual resultant of previous
conditions of its child-life throughout the length
and breadth of the land. At the present moment
the public mind is astray on this subject. There
is no understanding of the restraints necessary
on infantile wrong-doing, the wholesome because
painless checks to apply to juvenile delinquents.
Science must guide us to the right path of action,
society must enlist parental authority, or, if need
be, coerce the child to take the indicated course.
By the absence of wholesome checks and the
presence of brutal conditions in childhood we suffer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>a vast amount of preventible crime. We evolve
the criminal by sins of omission outside the prison;
we brutalize him further inside the prison by undue,
ill-adapted restraints.</p>

<p class='c004'>Very significant was the experience of Mr. Obermair,
of the State Prison in Munich. When appointed
governor there, he found from six to seven
hundred prisoners in the worst state of insubordination,
and whose excesses he was told defied
the harshest, most stringent discipline. The
prisoners were chained together. The guard consisted
of about 100 soldiers, who did duty not only
at the gates and round the walls, but in the passages,
and even in the workshops and dormitories;
and, strangest of all, from twenty to thirty large
dogs of the bloodhound breed were let loose at
night in the passages and courts to keep watch
and ward. The place was a perfect pandemonium,
comprising the worst passions, the most slavish
vices, and the most heartless tyranny within the
limits of a few acres.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Obermair quickly dispensed with dogs, and
nearly all the guards. He gradually relaxed the
harsh system, and treated the prisoners with a
consideration that gained their confidence. In
the year 1852 Mr. Baillie Cochrane visited the
prison, and his account is as follows: “The gates
were wide open, without any sentinel at the door,
and a guard of only twenty men idling away their
time in a room off the entrance hall.... None of
the doors were provided with bolts and bars; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>only security was an ordinary lock, and as in most
of the rooms the key was not turned, there was
no obstacle to the men walking into the passage....
Over each workshop some of the prisoners with
the best characters were appointed overseers, and
Mr. Obermair assured me that when a prisoner
transgressed a regulation, his companions told
him ‘<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">es ist verboten</span></i>,’ and it rarely happened that
he did not yield to the will of his fellow-prisoners.
Within the prison walls every description of work
is carried on&#160;... each prisoner by occupation and
industry maintains himself. The surplus of his
earnings is given him on release, which avoids his
being parted with in a state of destitution.” (This
account is taken from Herbert Spencer’s <cite>Essay
on Prison Ethics</cite>.) It is then clearly proved by
actual experience that rough handling and brutal
words—bolts and bars and bloodhounds—are alike
unnecessary in the case of first offenders and in
the case of the “desperate gang.”</p>

<p class='c004'>But, turning once more from the criminal to
the ultimate causes of crime, these are—destitution,
or more or less grinding poverty, inherited disease,
ignorance and all the degraded nurture that crushes
the humanities and develops the brutalities of
man. A scientific treatment of crime will eradicate
these various causes of crime. No summary
methods are applicable. There is no short cut
to the end in view; but by patient perseverance
in the scientific meliorism indicated in my chapters
on Industrial Life, Sex Relations and Parentage,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>and to be further explained in those on Education
and Home Life, the forces brought into play will
prove effective in social redemption. They are
essentially radical and all-embracing. Within
reformatories and prisons there may be partially
supplied the training for forming and reforming
character that is nowhere present in the homes
and schools of the lower classes to-day. Those
criminals who are not structurally defective may
recover moral health, and become virtuous or at
least harmless social units. In all such cases
liberty should be restored; but the State can
never be justified in discharging its rescued criminals
without resources and without protection. They
must be supplied with work, i.e. some means of
self-support, and guarded from dangers besetting
the critical period of liberation. The educating
of ignorant criminals, the reforming of corrigible
criminals, the restraining from further crime of
incurable criminals—these are duties of the State.</p>

<p class='c004'>The time, however distant, will finally arrive
when science, applied for generations to the task
of skilfully removing all the causes of crime, will
accomplish that glorious aim. By attention to
the laws of heredity, by checking the too rapid
increase of population, by the moral training of
every member of the community, and by well-ordered,
happy, domestic, industrial and social
life, the criminal nature will die out, and crime
itself be simply historical—a thing to study with
interest, an extirpated social disease.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>We must never forget that human aspirations, human
ideals, are as much a part of the phenomena which makes
up this causally-connected Universe as the instincts and
appetites that are common to man and the other animals.—<span class='sc'>David
G. Ritchie.</span></p>

  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER I<br /> <span class='large'>THE SENTIMENTS OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND SOCIAL JUSTICE</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The dawning century will have to undertake a new
education of mankind if we are not to relapse.... New
inventions are less needed than new ethics.—Dr. <span class='sc'>Max
Nordau</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Herbert Spencer tells us that: “Free institutions
can only be properly worked by men, each of whom
is jealous of his own rights and sympathetically
jealous of the rights of others—who will neither
himself aggress on his neighbour in small things or
great, nor tolerate aggression on them by others.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The state of mind or sentiment to which Mr.
Spencer here points is complex. It comprises an
egoism that is not anti-social, and an altruism that
is broadly social. The genesis of this sentiment is
intellectual, implying a recognition in some sort
of the laws of nature, by virtue of which individual
rights do not conflict with nature’s harmonies or its
fundamental organic unity. It is possible, therefore,
only to a race comparatively advanced, i.e. intellectually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>endowed; but the children and children’s
children of that race may possess the sentiment of
individual rights as an instinct with no apprehension
whatever of its source or its justification. Its alliance
with, and perfect conformity to, natural law
are certainly not understood, and confusion is increased
in the public mind by the unscientific teaching
of the daily press. Here, for instance, is a paragraph
from a middle-class journal. “Law is command,
control. Nature is instinctive force, and can neither
give nor receive laws. There are no laws of nature,
and there are no rights of man. We are using
meaningless phrases when we speak of either. Man
has no natural rights any more than the wolf and
the bear. All rights are conventional.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Now, before man had made a direct study of
nature, and, marking the invariability of sequence
in the precision of its phenomena, had attached to
that invariability the term “laws of nature,” the
word “law” denoted a lawgiver issuing arbitrary
commands. It is in this primitive sense that our
journalist uses the word “law.” He entirely ignores
its appropriation by science and the modern acceptation
of the term “laws of nature.” Nature has
no arbitrary commands, he says, and therefore infers
no laws. We admit the premise while denying the
inference. The laws of health are invariable, although
they do not necessarily dominate, since other
and opposing laws of disorganization may at any
moment get the upper hand. Man is competent to
disregard the laws of life; but if he so acts, another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>course of natural order is initiated, and he becomes
subject to pathological laws which conduct him
steadily to the grave. Necessity without arbitrary
command rules in the cosmos; and if happiness,
which all humanity desires, is attained, it will be by
conforming to all the laws of nature that favour
that end. Within, there are the laws of human
organization, without, the laws of circumstance or
environment. The humanity that has intellect and
scientific knowledge may, by union and co-operation,
take a firm advantage of these laws or uniformities
of nature and march steadily forward, controlling
the forces of nature by a willing obedience to natural
law.</p>

<p class='c004'>No sooner, observe, does this control become possible
than natural rights come into existence. Man
rises in the scale of being to a sphere of self-direction
and comparative liberty. The wolf and bear and
all wild animals are on the lower level, and have no
natural rights. They are controlled by forces external
to themselves, and the struggle for existence
and survival of the fittest is the law of destiny to
them. It is not so, however, with the horse, dog,
cat, etc., for man has lifted all domesticated animals
from under the rule of genetic forces, and placed
them under the rule of reasoned forces. He controls
their breeding, limits their numbers, and gives them
a happy life consistent with his own. Further, he
claims for them and concedes to them natural rights;
and note this point, the last phrase of our journalist’s
misleading paragraph is strictly true: “All rights are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>conventional.” Convention means by tacit agreement,
and it is by tacit agreement on the part of
civilized men that rights of men and rights of
animals exist and are respected. An impulse of
the higher life, viz., a law of sympathy, impels
civilized man to seek happiness for other beings as
well as himself, and intelligence shows him that
individual happiness promotes general happiness,
and further that no individual happiness is possible
without a certain amount of personal liberty.</p>

<p class='c004'>Individual rights, then, are a claim for a certain
amount of personal liberty, and the sentiment of
individual rights is an unconscious inward preparedness
to defend that claim. It lies at the very
foundation of modern ethics, since from it there
springs the outward equipoise of egoistic and
altruistic forces, the inward, subtle, delicate sense
of equitable relations, in other words, <em>justice</em>—the
moral backbone of the modern conscience.</p>

<p class='c004'>Let us see how we treat, in our nurseries, this
foundation of ethics, this sentiment of individual
rights. We enter a middle-class nursery where a
baby and his sister Jessie, a child of three years of
age, are side by side on the floor. An impulse
seizes baby to clutch the doll, which Jessie holds
firmly. Baby screams and nurse turns round and
lifts him in her arms. “See, Jessie,” she says, “he
wants your doll, surely you will be kind to baby
brother?” She takes the doll from Jessie and
gives it to the infant. Jessie throws herself on the
ground and kicks and screams. A paroxysm of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>emotion sweeps over her, and until the wave has
spent itself tranquillity in nerve or muscle is simply
impossible. But the nurse, ignorant of the fact
that the child is for the moment bereft of any power
of self-control, commands her to be still, and when
not obeyed, she scolds her severely. Finally she
puts her in a corner, and there poor Jessie sobs and
weeps till pure exhaustion brings her to passivity
and an abject state of mind which nurse calls “being
good again.” She signifies her approval of it by a
kiss of forgiveness as unmerited as the previous
anger.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now here we have an emotion supremely important
to the welfare of humanity rudely desecrated
in infancy. There was nothing base, sordid,
exclusive or even selfish in the tempest of feeling
that swept away the placidity of Jessie’s little soul.
Mingled together there was an impulse to defend her
personal rights and a hot indignation that any
infringement of these rights should occur. And the
whole was a wave of the complex forces destined to
weld society into an organic whole, capable of
maintaining free institutions. When the nurse
through ignorance punished the child for the
involuntary expression of a virtuous social-emotion,
she was opposing the very order of nature that
genetic evolution is striving to attain; she was
checking the progress of modern civilization.</p>

<p class='c004'>Later in the day Jessie with her doll restored to
her arms is happy again. Baby plays with his
rattle on nurse’s knee; but Jessie thinks, “My
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>dolly is a baby too and wants a rattle.” She takes
the rattle out of baby’s hands to give to dolly.
Baby shouts and kicks, and nurse is furious. She
slaps Jessie and calls her a “naughty child.” There
is no ebullition of anger this time, although the
tender little fingers ache from the rude blow.
Jessie shrinks aside with a subdued air. Had her
former rebellion been an impulse of pure vindictiveness
it would have repeated itself now. It had no
such feature. It revealed the fact that Jessie was
the offspring of a self-dependent, self-protective
race preparing for a new stage of social evolution,
and her aspect at the present crisis reveals the same.
She did not know she was in the wrong; but
vaguely she felt it. She had trespassed on baby’s
rights, and conscience dumbly stirred in her infant
bosom. If intelligence is strong the child questions
silently, “Why may baby take my doll when I may
not take his rattle?” The nurse will give no
answer. Her province is to feed and cleanse and
clothe her charges, and, if need be, punish action.
But the motive springs of action lie quite beyond
her range, and what is the consequence? If Jessie’s
intellect predominates over her emotional quality,
her conscience may develop, although under adverse
conditions; but if the balance tends the other way
the position is fatal. The child gathers her ideas
of right and wrong from the frowns and smiles, the
slaps or kisses of an ignorant woman who is ruling
the nursery with an authority purely barbaric, and
the budding conscience of a modern civilization
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>adapts itself to the archaic environment and reverts
or lapses backward.</p>

<p class='c004'>Further, observe, the nurse strove to create—in
this case, at least—sympathy towards a baby
brother. Was this wise? It was not wise, although
well-intentioned. Sympathy never develops under
command, and to order a child to be kind at the
moment when an aggression has been made on his
or her rights is like commanding a steam-engine to
move forward without turning on the steam!
Moreover, baby, young as he was, suffered mentally
and morally by the event. He learned an evil
lesson, viz., that if he cried he would probably get
what he wanted. Vigorously, though unconsciously,
he will pursue that vicious course and act
up to the principle.</p>

<p class='c004'>Does my reader inquire “What should the nurse
have done?” She should have instantly removed
the baby, saying gently to Jessie, “Children must
never take things from one another. Not even a
baby can be permitted to do that, and we must
teach him better. But see he is so young, he does
not know the doll is yours, not his. Would you like
to lend it to him for a little? No? Ah, well he
cannot have it then, but come and help me to
amuse him that he may forget the doll.” The
older child puts down her treasure to fondle her
baby brother, and there are ten chances to one that
by-and-bye her sympathy—called out naturally and
not by command—carries her a step further, and
she says: “Nurse, baby may hold my doll for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>little now.” Later, when the brilliant idea occurs
that dolly would enjoy the rattle, Jessie understands—she
does not blindly, vaguely feel, she knows—that
she must not trespass on baby’s rights. She
restrains her impulse therefore to snatch the rattle,
and in this self-control she is exercising the noblest
faculty of her nature under the dominion of a moral
conscience—a sense of justice or equivalence of
rights.</p>

<p class='c004'>And now we pass from an upper middle-class
nursery to any British boys’ school or playground.
We find that quarrels there arise not so much from
the simple barbarous impulses of cruelty, hatred,
revenge, fear, as from a different source—an effective
sense of personal rights unbalanced by an equally
effective sense of sympathy with the rights of others.
The phenomenon here is justice in embryo, self-conscious,
but lacking development on the altruistic
side. “It isn’t” or “it wasn’t fair” is a
phrase frequently upon a schoolboy’s lips, and it is
remarkable with what courage and dignity an
urchin of ten or twelve will criticize a master’s
treatment of him, and perhaps tell the man of fifty
to his face that this or that “wasn’t fair.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Were every boy as eager that all human beings—schoolmasters
included—should be as fairly treated
as he himself, the only further regulation of conduct
necessary would be a clear intelligence to discern
truth from falsehood in every case of misdemeanour.
Instructed intelligence is however a minus quantity,
and the sympathetic jealousy for the rights of others
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>that exists here and there amongst boys in minor
quantity, gets deflected from its true course. It
links boys of one age together in a mutual fellowship
that excludes masters and all others. Nor is this
difficult to understand. Mutual interests is the soil
in which sympathy grows; but with arbitrary
authority in the field, also conflicting desires, and no
distinct teaching on the subject, the deeper relations
of life, I mean the mutual interests of teacher and
taught and of the whole school as a social unity,
are often ignored. To shield a companion from
punishment, at all hazards, becomes virtue in a
schoolboy’s eyes, and antagonisms spring up with
confused notions of right and wrong, and a general
impulse to falsehood and deceit in special directions.
These are menacing features of character for the
social life of the future. Men of introspection have
recognized in themselves the baneful after-effects of
the clannishness engendered at school. Robert
Louis Stevenson bewailed the extreme difficulty he
had in forcing himself to perform a distinct public
duty. It involved some exposure dishonourable
to a former schoolmate! “I felt,” he said, “like a
cad!”</p>

<p class='c004'>From middle-class nurseries where authority is
chiefly barbaric and the budding conscience is hurt,
children destined to become the élite of a future
society and its rulers, pass into schools where there
is no clear and definite training for the emotional
nature, no scientific development of the social, and
repression of the anti-social impulses. From school
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>the student passes to college or university, and is
emancipated more or less from outward control.
When he enters upon the duties and pleasures of
adult life he presents, in many ways, an element of
social danger, for this simple reason, his native
bumptiousness, his sense of individual rights is not
held in check by an intelligent understanding of, and
feeling of sympathy with, the equal rights of others.
The groundwork of the modern conscience has been
tampered with while authority—propelled by genetic
forces of evolution—has gradually relaxed and
fallen back before the free-born British schoolboy.
By our present system of education we destroy
infant virtue in the nursery and in the school. We
dwarf that sympathy which should grow and expand
till it bursts forth in manhood into deeds of rectitude,
justice, love, manifesting the threefold quality of
human nature which alone is competent to lift the
whole area of man’s existence into line with cosmic
order. Our schools are yearly pouring into the
busy world a rich harvest of human aptitudes that
are quickly absorbed in activities mercantile,
professional, legislative, but the outcome of these
activities is not tuning life into social harmony, it is
merely increasing national wealth, and that without
any marked increase of plenty and pleasure to the
nation at large. The picture presented is one of
perpetual warfare—an outward struggle in money-making
for oneself and family, an inward contentious
spirit that reveals itself abroad in our blatant
imperialism, at home in class antagonisms—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>whole re-acting fatally on individual character and
lowering the general standard of civilized life.
Generous enthusiasms die down, the emotional
nature hardens, till intelligence itself is dimmed and
becomes incapable of any wide outlook that entails
unselfish effort.</p>

<p class='c004'>As a rule—though with honourable exceptions—our
compatriots advanced in life do not fulfil the
promise of their youth; and with forces of nature
amenable to man’s will, if wisely directed, real
progress in this scientific age is wofully sluggish.
We focus attention on environments that press on
adults only, and in seeking reform overlook the
environments that vitally effect our infant population,
therefore the adult life of the future.</p>

<p class='c004'>How different is our action in other directions. In
horticultural nurseries, for instance, progress is not
sluggish. Scientific discovery and methods of
practice are applied and promptly produce definite
results. The composite plants are distinguished
from simple plants, and while all are secured in
necessary conditions of healthy life—good soil, air,
light, etc.—those receive from the gardener a special
fostering care. He studies the laws of differentiation,
the peculiarities of each organism with its
hidden possibilities of varied efflorescence, and by
fitting environment to wider issues, watching them
day by day, nourishing every tendency favourable,
checking every tendency unfavourable, he induces an
outburst of blossom as varied in colour and form as
it is marvellous in beauty or grace, and that in spite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>of the fact that unaided by natural forces he is
utterly powerless to make a blade of grass grow.</p>

<p class='c004'>That human plants give promise of blossoming
into a <em>moral</em> beauty as yet undreamed of by the
British public is patent to any wise observer of the
confused social life of to-day. Our greatest realists
in fiction note the point. We have George Meredith
putting into the mouth of his hero, Matthew
Weyburn, these significant words: “Eminent
station among men doesn’t give a larger outlook&#160;...
I have come now and then across people we call
common, slow-minded, but hard in their grasp of
facts and ready to learn and logical. They were at
the bottom of wisdom, for they had in their heads
the delicate sense of justice upon which wisdom is
founded&#160;... that is what their rulers lack. Unless
we have the sense of justice abroad like a common
air there’s no peace and no steady advance. But
these humble people had it. I felt them to be my
superiors. On the other hand, I have not felt the
same with our senators, rulers and lawgivers. They
are for the most part deficient in the liberal mind.”
(<cite>Lord Ormont and his Aminta.</cite>)</p>

<p class='c004'>As regards physical health, I have shown the
necessity for stirpiculture and the birth of the fit;
as regards mental and moral health, i.e. Humanity’s
efflorescence on higher planes—the need of the times
is less eugenics than education and training. Germs
of truth, justice, love, lie latent in the basic structure
of our half-civilized race, and so long as we neglect
or destroy these germs it were folly to desire material
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>of finer quality. “Our raw material is of the very
best,” said the headmistress of a London Board
School, “our children are full of generous impulses
and fearless spontaneity. I sometimes think the
no-rule in the homes of the masses a better preparation
for life than the factitious training given in
homes of the classes. But our teachers are so few
and so seldom scientifically enlightened that we spoil
very much of the good material.” On behalf of the
classes my reader might argue that susceptibility to
beauty or the aesthetic sentiment with its creative
expression in art belongs almost exclusively to the
upper section of society, and is deemed by some
social reformers the very foundation of moral life,
the basis of the ethical temper.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is not my purpose to provoke comparison
between the classes and the masses, and I fully
recognize the value of the fine arts as factors in the
general elevation of life and character, but I submit
that evolution does not pursue the same line of
development in the various races of mankind, and in
the British race an advanced ethical temper is in
process of formation quite irrespective of the fine
arts and the aesthetic sentiment.</p>

<p class='c004'>Dr. Le Bon laid before the French Geographical
Society an account of a primitive group of people,
numbering several hundred thousand, who inhabit
a remote region high up among the Carpathian
mountains. Of this people, the Podhalians, he
says, “they are born improvisatori, poets and
musicians, singing their own songs, set to music
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>of their own composition. Their poetry is tender
and artless in sentiment, generous and elevated
in style.” He attributes these qualities to the
wealth of spontaneous resources possessed by
natures which neither know violent passions nor
unnatural excitements. The British race, moulded
by different conditions—geographical and historical—has
developed differently. Great masses
of our population are wholly insensitive to the
influences of art. The picture drawn by Wordsworth
of his Peter Bell comes nearer to our native
uncultured type—</p>

<p class='c017'>Nevertheless, through another channel he was

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The hard life of our workers has undoubtedly
deprived them, as yet, of any widespread aesthetic
development, but the chords of their vital part,
if played upon, produce a sentient state far removed
from the rudimentary stage. It is a product of
centuries of evolution.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>This humanity will move forward to higher planes
of existence, and a spiritual plenitude—of which
aestheticism is by no means the crown and glory,
but only an imperfect foretaste—by two convergent
paths trodden concurrently. These are a steady
growth in social qualities and the happiness that
flows from these qualities, the creation, in short,
of organic socialism; and the opening up outwardly
of channels of sympathy and community of interests
throughout the whole nation, causing the banishment
of class distinctions, the establishment of
an organized socialism. Perfection in art is not
the appropriate ideal for this age, but perfection in
social life, and it is not from a love of art to a love
of mankind and the practices of moral rectitude
that our masses will advance. It is by the practice
of all the humanities on ever broader, deeper lines,
until the nation, vibrating with harmonized life,
frames new visions of art, and strengthens all the
well-springs of art’s creation.</p>

<p class='c004'>The aestheticism that belongs exclusively to
one social class neither elevates general morals
nor produces the noblest art. Its narrowing influences
are exemplified in Lord Chesterfield’s
advice to his son: “If you love music, go to operas,
concerts, and pay fiddlers to play to you; but I
insist on your neither piping nor fiddling yourself.
It puts a gentleman in a contemptible light;&#160;... few things would mortify me more than to see
you bearing a part in a concert with a fiddle under
your chin.” Lord Chesterfield belonged to a past
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>century, but the spirit of his thought is not dead;
it manifests prominently to-day. In my own
experience a lady novelist was invited to a London
At Home, and accepted conditionally. If evening
costume were necessary she must decline, but if
less ceremonious dress were permissible she would
gladly appear, and the hostess consenting, she
did so. Now I heard a large group of middle-class
ladies passionately condemning this action,
on the ground that aestheticism had been outraged
and the rules of society set at nought by
a blot in rooms otherwise beautiful. Yet the
novelist had been tastefully attired, that was
freely admitted. She had sinned merely in nonconformity
to fashion and in covering her neck
and arms. Can we seriously believe that the
type of humanity to which these ladies belong
is developing the liberal mind which alone may
create and support the highest morality, the noblest
art? Are we not compelled to recognize the
truth of Mr. J. H. Levy’s profound remark: “In
the present stage of human progress the aesthetic
and the moral are conterminate at neither end.
Aesthetic emotion may be roused in us by that
which is ethically odious, and moral feeling may
be called up by that which is artistically ugly.”
(<cite>The National Reformer.</cite>)</p>

<p class='c004'>The true ethical temper is engendered by a
complexity of social attractions issuing in an inward
sense of justice and the delicate equipoise
of natural rights between <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">meum</span></i> and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tuum</span></i>. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>task before us is to unite the half-conscious, instinctive
justice already existent with an intellectual
apprehension and clear understanding of
right and wrong, in other words, to complete
the modern conscience; and in view of this task
we must distinctly realize that the sentiment of
what is proper and improper in conventional
society has no ethical value, and is a false guide
to conduct.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>The facts which it is at once most important and most
difficult to appreciate are what may be called the facts of
feeling.—<span class='sc'>Lecky.</span></p>

<p class='c008'>The area of man’s emotional life is one of vast
magnitude. It lies behind the scenes of his outward
existence, yet it interpenetrates the social
structure throughout, and stretches beyond it to
distances we know not whence or whither. Mysterious
as this region is, no sooner does man aspire
to control the social forces of collective life, as he
already largely controls the natural forces of
physical life, than he is compelled to apply his
reason scientifically to the phenomena of human
emotions, and to contemplate, trace out and master
there the general features of the process of evolution.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the case of personal development the task
is comparatively easy. A child’s feelings are
simple, not compound. For the most part they
seem vague and indefinite, always fleeting and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>evanescent; but as the child grows his powers
of feeling grow likewise and alter in character.
Their childish simplicity passes away; they augment
in mass, they become complex, more permanent
and coherent in their nature, and far
more delicate in susceptibility. Consequently the
breadth of range, the depth and richness of emotion
possible in an adult, as compared with the emotions
of a child, are as the music of an organ to the sweet
notes that lie within the compass of a penny whistle.</p>

<p class='c004'>In racial development evolution of feeling has
not pursued one invariable course. Distinctive
sentiments and modes of feeling characterize the
different races of mankind as well as distinctive
outward features, and the impressing on a plastic
race of these divergent states of feeling is mainly,
though not entirely, due to external conditions—not
climatic and geographical conditions only,
but also the form of civilization that had taken
root and moulded the habits and customs of the
race. Greek civilization, for instance, tended to
develop largely the aesthetic group of feelings,
while in Scotland these feelings, through outward
influences I must not pause to consider, have been
stunted in growth, and moral sentiments have had
a deeper and firmer development.</p>

<p class='c004'>Amongst barbarous tribes of men the violent
emotions—anger, fear, jealousy, revenge—generally
speaking, hold sway; but there are also in various
parts of the world uncivilized communities where
these fierce passions are little known, and where,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>in consequence of the absence of warlike surroundings,
the gentle, tender sentiments that have for
their foundation family ties and peaceful social
life, prevail, and are considerably developed.</p>

<p class='c004'>The conditions of emotional evolution in a given
race, then, are complex. We have to bear in
mind a threefold environment—cosmic, planetary,
social—pressing upon individual life and powerfully
swaying the emotional part of it. Social
environment is pre-eminently potent in modifying
emotional characteristics; yet the prime factor
of change in social environment springs from this
region of feeling, and this factor may, under
rational guidance, take a path of direct and rapid
progression.</p>

<p class='c004'>British civilization is the product of a turbulent,
militant stage of evolution, an epoch of military
glory, followed by a long period of industrial development
and commercial activity. We inherit
a survival of virtues and vices from each of these
evolutional stages. To the first we attribute our
courage, independence and proper pride, both
national and individual; and we are apt to suppose
that without the experience of military glory
our manly John Bull would have been a milk-sop.
That may or may not be true; but when we infer
that the above characteristics depend fundamentally
and absolutely upon a military environment
we are vastly mistaken. Observe what is
said by travellers and missionaries of certain unwarlike
tribes found in India and the Malay Peninsula.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>The Jakuns are inclined, we are told, to
gratitude and beneficence, their tendency being
not to ask favours, but to confer them. The
Arifuras have a very excusable ambition to gain the
name of rich men by paying the debts of their
poorer fellow-villagers! One gentle Arifura, who
had hoped to be chosen chief of his village and
was not, met his disappointment with the spirit
of a philosopher and philanthropist, saying:
“What reason have I to grieve? I still have it
in my power to assist my fellow-villagers.” When
brought into contact with men of an opposite
type—hardy, fierce and turbulent, they have no
tendency to show the white feather. The amiable
Dhimal is independent and courageous, and resists
“with dogged obstinacy” injunctions that are
urged injudiciously. The Jakun is extremely
proud—his pride showing itself in refusals to be
domesticated and made useful to men of a different
race and therefore alien to himself. The simple-minded
Santal has a “strong natural sense of
justice, and should any attempt be made to coerce
him, he flies the country. The Santal is courteous
and hospitable, whilst at the same time he is free
from cringing.” Dalton writes of the Hos—a
tribe belonging to the same group as the Santals—“a
reflection on a man’s honesty or veracity
may be sufficient to send him to self-destruction”;
and of the Lepchas, Hooker says, “In all my dealings
with them they have proved scrupulously
honest.... They cheer on the traveller by their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>unostentatious zeal in his service, and when a
present is given to them, it is divided equally
among many without a syllable of discontent or
a grudging look or word.”<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c015'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

630, 631.</p>
</div>

<p class='c004'>From these facts we gather that a number of
virtues associated in our minds with Western
civilization are present amid barbarous tribes,
and that the vices associated by us with barbarism—cruelty,
dishonesty, treachery, selfishness—are
in some cases glaringly absent. Human nature
is not dependent on culture or Christianity to
humanize and make it lovable. There is that in
the very groundwork of its nature which renders
it capable of developing, under favourable conditions,
into what is admirable, pure and gracious.
The traits given us of these peoples show virtue,
truth, generosity, moral courage and justice, and
what nobler, more elevated sentiments have as
yet been found in civilized man?</p>

<p class='c004'>The favourable conditions are an entire absence
of warlike surroundings and warlike training,
hence an absence also of any inheritance of warlike
proclivities. These tribes “have remained unmolested
for generation after generation; they
have inflicted no injuries on others.” Their social
or unselfish feelings have been fostered and nourished
by the sympathetic intercourse of a peaceful
life.</p>

<p class='c004'>In a purely military state unselfish feelings are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>necessarily repressed, whilst the bold, keen, hard
and cruel side of human nature is liberally developed.
To hate an enemy and avenge an injury are manly
virtues. The predatory instincts are useful and
approved. Treachery is not discredited, and the
man clever enough to take advantage of an enemy
and successfully intrigue against him may be
ranked among the gods! The plunderer who
falters not in keen pursuit of prey and in the hour
of victory shows relentless cruelty is deemed heroic.
No thought of happiness or misery to others gives
him pause; military glory is his absorbing aim,
and in the intervals of peace his callous nature
manifests in ruling with tyrannic power slavish
subordinates, who bend and cringe before him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now let us glance at two of these militant
characteristics, viz. rapacity and personal pride,
with a view to observe how their survival into
our industrial epoch has vitiated the national
life.</p>

<p class='c004'>The purely militant stage of British development
has passed, and the outward form of our collective
life is industrial, not military. A sanguinary
path of glory has no intrinsic fascination for our
people, and there is no national desire to conquer
and rule over races established on other parts
of the earth’s surface, however superior to ours
may be their climate and quarters. Nevertheless,
within the last half century we have fought battles
and shed blood copiously in China, Persia, Afghanistan,
Abyssinia, Egypt, South Africa and elsewhere.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>Seldom, however, has the nation itself
clamoured for war. In the year 1854 a relapse
into militant mood occurred, and, in spite of unwillingness
on the part of individual rulers, the
Government yielded to a sinister wave of barbaric
feeling in the nation—a martial frenzy that
impelled to the Crimean War. Since that period
wars have originated from other causes than the
will of the nation. Our people, immersed in a
painful struggle for livelihood at home, are indifferent
to the rights and wrongs of the many
squabbles into which we flounder abroad. General
malevolence has no part in this matter; our real
collective attitude towards foreigners is one of
friendliness, combined with an impulse to the
peaceful exchange of commodities, kind words and
gentle arts—the whole provocative of love, not
hatred.</p>

<p class='c004'>The fundamental causes of war, then, have
been: first, the commercial interests of a capitalist
class, or, if expressed in terms of feeling, the desire
in that class for increased wealth—a desire partly
the product of inherited rapacity, a sentiment
descended to us from our militant epoch; second,
national pride—a pride which has kindled animosities,
embroiled us in disputes and dragged us
into wars, the pettiness of whose small beginnings
is only matched by the pettiness of British conduct
throughout their whole extent. But both this
rapacity and this national pride belong almost
exclusively to our ruling classes. Their existence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>is explained by the action of outward conditions
on special sections of the community. The British
passed suddenly out of a period of constant fighting
and feud into a period of frantic industrial activity.
Feudal chiefs and their descendants became grasping
landlords. There also sprang up a class of
sharp-witted, keen-sighted men, whose native
rapacity strengthened in the genial hot-bed of
our brilliant commercial success. A tremendous
start in the international race after wealth was
secured to Great Britain by her possession of iron,
coal, etc. She absorbed riches from every quarter
of the globe, and mercantile triumph swelled the
pride already deeply implanted in our industrial
organizers, our politicians and plenipotentiaries.
The great mass of the people were differently
affected by industrial conditions. Workers of
every description, packed together in towns and
factories, rapidly developed the qualities of intimate
social life, and out-grew, in the main, the
savage instincts of militancy. Our commercial
wars and Imperialistic policy are fruits—not of
the nation’s brutality, its greed, or its pride, but
of its simple ignorance and its blind trust in individuals
peculiarly unfitted by inheritance and
personal bias to guide it aright in relations with
other, and especially with weaker, nations. All
the wars of recent times—a record of cruel bloodshed
causing needless sorrow and suffering to the
innocent—have been instigated by the ruling
classes under the dominion of rapacity and pride.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>When these ruling classes are dispossessed of
supreme power, and civilized democracies assume
public responsibility with political supremacy, the
day of disarming of nations will dawn. The world’s
workers who, apart from their rulers, have no tendency
to undue accumulation or national pride,
but whose bias, on the contrary, is towards sympathetic
co-operation in industry, will strenuously
seek the joys and blessings of universal peace.</p>

<p class='c004'>But although the war-spirit of the ancient Briton
dies out and general brutality declines, individual
brutality, practised privately, is common enough.
Class tyranny, sex tyranny, and much of domestic
tyranny are rampant; and the co-relative feelings,
viz. abject fear giving rise to hatred, anger, malice,
cunning and despicable meanness of soul, are all
strongly in evidence.</p>

<p class='c004'>The industrial system that succeeded our military
system is of no genuinely social type. It is distinctly
contentious, and when we consider how
it has pressed for about a century upon a plastic
race inwardly prone to every vice engendered by
militancy, the matter for surprise perhaps is that
we are as good as we are.</p>

<p class='c004'>In classifying emotional states there is a sentiment
which, if not begotten, has at least been
bred, nourished and widely diffused during our
industrial epoch—I mean the sentiment, love of
property. On no subject are opposite opinions
more strongly and disputatiously held than on
the question of the nature and value of this sentiment.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>It is claimed by some as not only the chief
support of present-day society, but the prime
evolutional factor of our entire civilization. A
savage only cares to secure the things he is in
immediate need of. He lacks imagination to
picture what he may want to-morrow, also intelligence
to provide for future contingencies and
sympathetic desire to provide for the wants of
others.</p>

<p class='c004'>No sooner, however, does an established government
give safe protection to individual property
than prudence and forethought appear. The man
who acquires property soon surrounds himself
with comforts, and inspires in others the desire
to follow his example. Social wealth accumulates,
and energies are set free for further development.
Some social units become complex, intellectual
tastes and love of travel arise, and works
of art—the treasure-trove of earlier civilizations—are
impounded to lay the foundation of artistic
life in the later civilization. Aesthetic culture
now grows rapidly. Painting, poetry, music
abound, and men may be lifted above the meaner
cares of existence to an inward freedom, where
sympathy expands through the exercise of elevated
thought and feeling. Is not love of property,
then, a sentiment to honour and conserve? Its
genesis and history certainly command respect;
but the already quoted case of the Podhalians
proves that by no means is it an essential in human
evolution. To that primitive people, as Dr. Le Bon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>has shown, riches have no charms; they are poor,
living principally upon oats made into cakes and
goat’s milk. They enjoy perfect health and live
long. They are quick in apprehension, fond of
dancing, singing, music and poetry. There is
clearly no development here of the property-sense,
yet the Podhalians have a very considerable development
of that group of emotions we term
aesthetic and regard as an evidence of high refinement
and culture. We are not therefore logically
entitled to claim that were British love of property
and British cupidity greatly diminished, art as a
consequence must needs decay and the race revert
into barbarism.</p>

<p class='c004'>Herbert Spencer tells us “that in some established
societies there has been a constant exercise
of the feeling which is satisfied by a provision for
the future, and a growth of this feeling so great
that it now prompts accumulation to an extent
beyond what is needful.” (1st vol. of <cite>Essays</cite>,
2nd series, p. 132.)</p>

<p class='c004'>That point has been overpassed by the British.
What we have now to struggle against are varied
evils arising from a glut of national wealth (but
I do not mean by this term commodities of intrinsic
value, only wealth representing an acknowledged
claim on the labour of others) and a frightful
inflation of the sentiments allied with wealth,
which at one time were useful, but for generations
have been producing outward vice and inward
misery and corruption.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>The British merchant goes on accumulating long
after he has amply provided for himself and family,
and many a poor man feels towards that other’s
wealth precisely as a savage feels towards his
fetish. He is filled with reverence, admiration,
desire and a sense of distance from the golden calf
that makes him hopeless, abject, despairing.</p>

<p class='c004'>The American millionaire, as depicted by Mr.
Howells, will, “on a hot day, when the mortal
glare of the sun blazes in upon heart and brain,
plot and plan in his New York office till he swoons
at the desk.” Such a man is as much a victim
to over-development of acquisitiveness as the
drunkard is victim to an undue development of
the love of stimulants, and in each case the depraved
taste carries ruin to the individual and
havoc into society. Social unity is rent in twain.
A life of exuberant wealth and extravagant expenditure
runs parallel with one of constant, inescapable
poverty, and so long as the nation continues
to heap up riches in private possession,
just so long must we reap an emotional harvest
of envy, malice, private animosities, class hatreds
and a subtle estrangement of heart throughout the
length and breadth of the land. Yet even the
great poet Tennyson in his writings exalts into a
worthy motive for holy wedlock this sentiment—love
of property. An affectionate father, in the
poem, “The Sisters,” exhorts his daughters thus:
“One should marry, or&#160;... all the broad lands
will pass collaterally”!</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>The small accumulator whose petty hoard of gold
was gloated over piece by piece has long been
labelled miser. He is publicly condemned, and
in literature derided. But the merchant-prince
who, already wealthy, devotes days and years
and his whole mind and heart to business; the
proprietor of broad lands who adds acre to acre,
and anxiously meditates on their passing collaterally;
the rich capitalist who craftily seeks to lower
wages in the interests of employers; the gambler
on the Stock Exchange; the market manipulator
whose predatory instincts are so pleasurably excited
by risks and gains that he will hazard in the game
all that nobler men hold precious—these beings,
I say, are as worthy of scorn and infinitely more
baneful than the miser. They must take their
true place by his side in public estimation. They
are social deformities, morally diseased. In other
words, these men are incapable of moral duty,
which consists in “the observance of those rules
of conduct that contribute to the welfare of society—the
end of society being peace and mutual protection,
so that the individual may reach the fullest
and highest life attainable by man.” (<cite>Huxley’s
Life</cite>, vol. ii. p. 305.)</p>

<p class='c004'>In the preceding chapter I have shown that
the self-regarding sentiment exercised with due
consideration for the welfare of others is a social
virtue. It promotes national prosperity and personal
improvement. But self-regarding actions,
induced by this master-passion over-acquisitiveness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>invariably issue in automatic selfishness and
general deterioration.</p>

<p class='c004'>In regard to aesthetic emotions also the cleavage
between rich and poor has a fatal significance. A
luxurious, idle, for the most part, inane, life led
by the rich, profoundly influences the poor; not
by creating anti-social feeling only, but by checking
aesthetic development. In the city of many
slums there is also a west-end of gay shops filled
with objects <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de luxe</span></i>, of showily dressed women,
profligate men, theatre, music-hall and ball-room
entrances, at which to stand gazing as into a
fairy peep-show. Suggestion here plays a mischievous
part. Poverty hinders the purchase of
all commodities that possess any real artistic value,
but commercial enterprise has flooded the markets
with meretricious imitations. East-end shops reflect
the glitter and glow of west-end attractions,
and the ignorant, spell-bound by suggestion, become
possessors of that which degrades and vulgarizes
taste or the sense of the beautiful. Now
that science partially dominates thought, our
eyes have been opened to the fact of essential
unity in human groups. We may trace the cause
of a social evil to a special section or class, but
the effects of that cause radiate forth till they touch
<em>every</em> section or class. Dwellers in the west-end
cannot escape disease propagated by the vilely
unwholesome conditions of life at the east-end.
Micro-organisms of disease are wafted from hither
to thither, and on the physical plane social unity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>is recognized. A like continuity exists on the
non-physical side. Minds are as closely united
by psychical law as bodies by physical law. The
experienced facts of hypnotism make this clear,
and the logical inference is that in Western civilization
the vices of wealthy classes infect and corrupt
the masses.</p>

<p class='c004'>That the imagination of the great mass of our
people should be snared and their evolutional
progress thwarted by mental suggestion from a
banal, vicious life led by a comparatively small
portion of the nation, is an outrage on civilization.
It renders it imperative that the cause of this evil,
viz., our contentious, i.e. our competitive system
of industry, should be fundamentally changed.</p>

<p class='c004'>For every group of human beings the steady
growth of those social qualities which create happiness
and the steady advance in intellectual,
aesthetic and spiritual life, depend on a close community
of interests and the constant opening up
of fresh channels of sympathy throughout the
group. But the British racial group has lost this
community of interests—this primary condition
of steady growth. It is split up into, first, a class
of property possessors made effeminate by ill-spent
leisure, often inflated by pride, and at all
times demanding the artificial pleasures of a
luxurious life; second, a class striving to amass
property, a class whose thoughts and desires circle
round and centre in property, and who to acquire
it often sacrifice serenity of mind, health of body,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>and even life itself; and third, the mass of the
people who, having no property, are yet enslaved
by it, and who on the emotional side of their human
nature are debased and corrupted by the mental
state of the classes.</p>

<p class='c004'>As evolution approaches the era of manhood
of human reason it becomes conscious, and demands
a national effort to improve. That effort
first appears in the strenuous, scientific study of
life as it is, in attempts at social reconstruction,
and at improvement in public and private education.
It is seen to be necessary to stamp out all
the militant and predatory instincts of mankind
by ethical nurture and training, while all the gentle,
gracious qualities of mankind must be carefully
guarded and nourished, until, in every social unit
the effort to improve is habitual, i.e. has become
“the essential mode of its being.” (J. McGavin
Sloan.)</p>

<p class='c018'>The danger that confronts the new century is the recrudescence
of racial antipathies and national animosities.—<span class='sc'>Hermann
Adler.</span></p>

<p class='c008'>The passion of jealousy has a long and significant
history, and a pedigree more ancient than the
allied sentiment, love of property, which has just
been considered. The passion was useful to the
welfare of the tribe at an early period, but it survives
as purely a vice in the midst of consolidated
nations, for it is essentially anti-social, not necessary
to general welfare, and impossible to be exercised
sympathetically or for the good of others.
If I am jealous it means that I have a source of
personal delight that I would guard from others
and monopolise if I could. The happiness may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>be self-produced or rest on a being whom I love.
In both cases it causes within me fears of interference,
suspicion of my fellows, and a general
tendency to dislike, nay, even to hate them if
they dare to meddle with my secret joy. The
emotion is fundamentally selfish, and when an
individual is sympathetic all round he becomes
incapable of it. He has risen above the egoistic
passion of jealousy.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Darwin tells us that amongst savages addicted
to “intemperance, utter licentiousness and unnatural
crimes, no sooner does marriage, whether
polygamous or monogamous, become common than
jealousy leads to the inculcation of female virtue.”
This gives the clue to the problem of jealousy’s
evolutional value. It has played a part in the
destiny of woman, and tended to shape her
emotional nature. Its history is inextricably intertwined
with hers, in all the varying degrees of
servitude that mark her slow advance from a
condition of absolute chattelism to one of rational
equality with man.</p>

<p class='c004'>By virtue of superior strength man has acted
on the theory that he was made for God, and
woman for him! and in the process of establishing
his dominancy jealousy appeared and aided powerfully
the gradual development of a new emotion—constancy,
a social grace and virtue as certain to
wax and grow as jealousy is to wane and slowly
disappear.</p>

<p class='c004'>In literature one finds a reflection of the entire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>history of jealousy and all its consecutive changes
from barbarous times through the ages, when frequent
duels witnessed to the honourable place
it held in public estimation down to the present
day, when it is somewhat discredited, and duelling—in
Great Britain at least—has ceased altogether.
To track this history were impossible here; I
can only point to one or two significant pictures.</p>

<p class='c004'>The play of “Othello” depicts the barbarous social
conditions in which jealousy flourishes. Shakespeare
reveals both the anti-social nature of the
passion and the intellectual weakness of the mind
that harbours it. “Trifles light as air,” says Iago,
“are to the jealous confirmation strong as proofs
of holy writ.” And in effect Othello is incapable
of sifting evidence. The poor device of the stolen
handkerchief seals the fate of Desdemona!
Woman’s subject position is plainly set forth, and
the foundations of the passion in masculine master-hood
and pride of power are fully exposed. Othello’s
wife must be his slave and puppet. “Out of my
sight,” he cries, and patiently she goes. “Mistress,”
he calls, and she returns. “You did wish,”
he says to Lodovico, “that I would make her
turn.” Desdemona is the very type of patient,
gentle, enslaved womanhood, the ideal woman
of a rough, brutal age. Her father describes her
as—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A maiden never bold;</div>
      <div class='line'>Of spirit so still and quiet, that her motion</div>
      <div class='line'>Blush’d at herself.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>Observe, however, inwardly she is more advanced
than the men. She perceives the low
nature of jealousy, and to Emilia says touchingly,
“My noble Moor is true of mind, and made of no
such baseness as jealous creatures are.” Alas,
for her generous confidence! And when the base
passion transforms her “noble Moor” into a
monster of cruelty, she, true to the type of her
sex at the period, resembles a pet dog that fawns
upon and licks the hand that strikes him. This
patient moan is all her utterance—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>’Tis meet I should be used so, very meet,</div>
      <div class='line'>How have I been behaved that he might stick</div>
      <div class='line'>The small’st opinion on my least misuse.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>The only dignity she shows is in her refusal to
display her sorrow before Emilia:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in4'>Do not talk to me, Emilia;</div>
      <div class='line'>I cannot weep, nor answer I have none.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Jealousy and duelling flourished long after the
Shakesperian period. Prose fiction in the eighteenth
century is full of the subject of masculine
rivalry in the appropriation of the female sex.
The woman passionately desired is the prize or
reward of a victory in which the hero has manifested
adroitness in arts of bloodshed. Feminine
will plays no part in the decision to which man
the heroine shall belong, and the rivals for her
possession make no pretence of superior character
as a claim on her favour. The gentle spiritual
qualities that alone create union of heart and mind
seem unknown. Master-hood, an apotheosis of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>force, is the key to the drama; and the rapid rise
of the novel in public esteem shows that pleasurable
sensations were closely allied with the barbarous
actions and feelings that belong to a militant age.</p>

<p class='c004'>Early in the nineteenth century George Eliot
draws the hero of her first great novel (<cite>Adam Bede</cite>)
in the act of picking a quarrel with a rival for a
woman’s love. She shows jealousy in him springing
chiefly from a sense of property in Hetty.
The wounded pride and self-importance of a too
despotic nature finds relief in fighting Arthur
Donnithorne. In <cite>Middlemarch</cite> the transition to
a higher stage of evolution is marked. She gives
us there a graphic picture of a woman wrestling
with jealousy in the secrecy of her own chamber,
and correctly places in the tenderly emotional
nature of that sex the primary impulse to subdue
the vile passion. Female jealousy made no appeal
to arms, but in a thousand subtle ways it was
sending forth currents of anti-social force, and
without a widespread feminine repudiation of
jealousy no clear advance to higher social life was
possible. Dorothea is a true type of progressing
womanhood. She gains a victory in the noble
warfare we see her waging inwardly, and, rising
far above the vile passion, she goes forth to her
rival in a glow of generous emotion that not only
compels the confidence of the latter, but for the
time draws that selfish, narrow nature up to the
level of her own.</p>

<p class='c004'>There is no false note in this picture, and if we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>glance at the transcript of real life at the period
we may easily find its counterpart. The well-known
writer, Mrs. Jamieson (in her <cite>Commonplace
Book</cite>) relates: “I was not more than six years
old when I suffered, from the fear of not being
loved, and from the idea that another was preferred
before me, such anguish as had nearly killed
me! Whether those around me regarded it as
a fit of ill-temper or a fit of illness I do not know.
I could not then have given a name to the pang
that fevered me, but I never forgot that suffering.
It left a deep impression, and the recollection was
so far salutary that in after life I guarded myself
against the approaches of that hateful, deformed,
agonizing thing which men call jealousy, as I
would from an attack of cramp or cholera. If
such self-knowledge has not saved me from the
pain, at least it has saved me from the demoralizing
effects of the passion, by a wholesome terror and
even a sort of disgust.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The knell of a departing phase of inner life was
sounding when womanhood acquired the power
to sift evidence from childish recollections, to
detect the utter uselessness of the suffering jealousy
creates and the ignominy of allowing it to become
a cause of suffering at all.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mrs. Jamieson stands on the threshold of a new
era, for critical intellect here enters the sphere
of the emotions, and these, yielding to guidance
and control, human reason is henceforth a prime
factor in emotional evolution.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>But further, sympathy when developed to a
certain point inevitably leads men astray if not
guided by reason. Let me here relate a sequence
of events that occurred in my own experience.</p>

<p class='c004'>Two girls became deeply attached; they worked
and studied together, and their friendship was a
source of constant joy. In course of time, however,
one married, and the other girl felt forsaken.
She suffered from jealousy, and imagined that the
husband would suffer similarly if she kept her
place in her friend’s affections. A husband’s
right amounted, in her view, to a monopoly of
a wife’s tenderness. She strove, therefore, to
loosen the bond of friendship; to cool her own
ardent affection and make no claims, lest it should
disturb conjugal bliss. The action was brave and
prompted by sympathy, but it did not make for
happiness. In a few short years the wife on her
deathbed spoke thus to her former friend: “Why
did you separate yourself from me? How could
you think my love would change? I have been
happy in my husband and child, but love never
narrowed, it widened me. There was plenty of
room for friendship, too. I sorely missed you,
and felt your loss threw a shadow over my married
life.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Sympathy alone, then, is no unerring guide to
conduct. Nevertheless, in a society permeated
by true knowledge of the nature of the emotions
and their significance in evolution primitive good-feeling
may evolve, passing through each stage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>from the basic or simple to the complex, and every
generous emotion prove accordant with the truth
of things, and therefore productive of inward joy
and outward right action, i.e. action tending to
general welfare even in all the labyrinthine complexities
of a high civilization. <em>Emotion accordant
with the truth of things</em>—that is the crux of the
position; and again I can best illustrate the point
by reference to events that occurred within my
own knowledge—events, too, by no means uncommon.
During eight years a girl was engaged
to marry a man we shall call Roger. He was in
India and she in England. They corresponded,
but meanwhile an intimacy sprang up between
the girl and another man—we may call him Mark—to
whom unwittingly her heart went out more
warmly than it had ever done to Roger. She
thought the relation to Mark was one of pure
friendship, and he knew nothing of her engagement
to Roger. The latter’s approaching return
to England, however, opened the girl’s eyes to
her true position, and on Mark it fell as a cruel
blow. He had courted affection and responded
to it in all sincerity, and was merely withheld from
an open avowal by the consciousness of, as yet,
insufficient means to justify his suit in the eyes of
her parents. When concealment was at an end
the problem to him seemed simple enough.
“Which do you love best?” he asked, and added
dominantly, “he is the man you should marry.”
The girl was not convinced. The knowledge that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>she could not love Roger best filled her with tenderness
towards him. Her emotional nature—wide
enough to embrace both rivals with sympathy—could
give no decision, and intellect was confused
by false teaching in childhood. “Duty,” she
thought, “is always difficult; ought I not then
to choose the hardest path of the two before me,
and give up Mark?” In this grave dilemma
she turned for advice to an elderly man on whose
judgment she felt reliance. Bravely and truthfully
she stated her case, innocently betraying
that ignorance and the wish to do right were dangerously
near carrying her into action that was
wrong. “Let us reverse the position,” said her
mentor. “Roger, we shall suppose, has written
to you to come out to India and marry him, the
fact being he has fallen in love with another girl.
He did not mean to do that. His heart slipped
away from you to her unconsciously, and he is
shocked, and blames himself, not wholly without
cause. But being an honourable man, he reasons
with himself thus: ‘I am bound to keep my engagement
to Mary; I will do so, and strive to
make her happy.’ He meets you then with a lie
in his heart, not on his tongue, for he will say
nothing of your rival and of his sacrifice and pain.
Would you be happy, think you? Would you
miss nothing? And if later you discovered the
truth, would you feel that the generous action was
a just one to you?” “No, no,” she cried, “I
never could wish him to sacrifice his happiness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>to mine; I would infinitely rather he told me the
truth, and married the other girl.” “Precisely
so,” said her friend, “the truth is always best;
but I see you think Roger is less unselfish than
you are! Is that just to him?” “I hardly
know,” she murmured, “men are jealous, are
they not?” “Jealous, ah, well, we men are
frail, no doubt! But were I Roger, I tell you
frankly, it would not mend matters to me that
I had won my wife without the priceless jewel of
her love. Be true to yourself, my young friend,
that means also justice to him, and fling to the
winds all fears that make you swerve from the path
of open rectitude.” The girl fulfilled her difficult
task. She relinquished the heroic mood, met
her first lover with perfect candour, and a short
time later became Mark’s wife. “Roger freed
me at once,” she said to her wise mentor; “he’d
rather have my friendship, which is perfectly
sincere, than love with a strain of falseness. Oh,
I am glad, and yet I know he grieves; I would
give much to be able to console him!” “Ah,”
said her friend, “beware of sentimentality and
self-importance there. Roger’s consolation will
come through his own true heart. In time he
will love again. See to it that you ‘let the dead
past bury its dead.’”</p>

<p class='c004'>Loyalty to truth is not firmly rooted in humanity,
while without truth as its guiding principle social
feeling, constantly rising, overflows old channels
and floods with new dangers the semi-civilization
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>of the present. There is no escape at this juncture
from the absolute necessity of developing the
critical faculty and applying it to the social questions
of the day; in other words, using reason,
intelligence, knowledge, as the guides and controllers
of feeling.</p>

<p class='c004'>We turn now from personal emotions to an
emotion that sways mankind collectively, and manifests
itself in still more direful results than those of
individual jealousy. Patriotism, like jealousy, is
of ancient origin, and at one time possessed social
utility. Without it there could hardly have occurred
the transformation of vagrant tribes into
massive communities solidly established on one
portion of the earth’s surface and sectionally
swarming to other portions as occasion requires.</p>

<p class='c004'>The original element holding a tribe together
has been termed by a recent sociologist “consciousness
of kind,” i.e. a feeling not dependent on
intellectual congeniality or emotional sympathy,
but simply on nearness in place, time and blood.
With tribal growth cohesion proves necessary to
self-protection from adverse environments, whether
of natural forces, wild animals or human foes.
Experience reveals that union is strength, and
hostility to other tribes fosters union in opposition.
The inward attitude becomes complex; it embraces
cohesion and repulsion; it is essentially
a <em>union in enmity</em>. Now we have seen how in
boyhood an innocent camaraderie or <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de
corps</span></i> begets injustice to schoolmasters, and balks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>the development of the modern conscience; similarly
here there are ethical dangers inseparable
from a sentiment that beginning in “consciousness
of kind” expands into sociality, yet has a
converse side of hostility and hate. At the present
day patriotism and international warfare are
closely combined. The student of life who knows
that the general trend of evolution is towards a
reign of universal peace, recognizes that although
nations have been consolidated by outward warfare
and inward patriotism, this sentiment, so limited
in range and so largely anti-social, can be no virtue
for all time. Patriotism belongs to the militant
stage of national history, and as regards Great
Britain it is plainly out of date. Its action is
not good, but evil.</p>

<p class='c004'>The war in South Africa begun in 1899 was not
caused by racial enmity, but by mercantile enterprise.
Economic forces involved in Great Britain’s
competitive commercial system were the prime
factors in its creation, but without the existence
of a vague unintelligent patriotic sentiment in
the country generally the Government would not
have been supported by the people in the prosecution
of that war. Our enfranchised masses,
fired by a sudden enthusiasm and racked by sympathy
in the brave deeds and cruel sufferings of
our soldiers and sailors, saw the phantasmagoria
of modern warfare in false colours. Imagination
was grasped and controlled by a press working—though
half-unconsciously—in the interests of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>special mercantile class; and while tender emotions
overflowed in generous help to one’s own kind,
a sympathy stimulated by public laudation, the
reverse side of the picture was ignored. But in
this, as in all wars, sympathy had its counterpoise
in antagonism and rancorous enmity. All the
brutal instincts latent in a race that had fought
its way to supremacy among European Powers
were roused afresh and stirred into fatal activity,
and the evolving modern conscience and sentiments
of justice, honour, truth towards all men,
were checked and overborne by a loyalty that
condones the fierce primitive passions. Hatred
and uncharitableness were even voiced from some
pulpits, and the term Pro-Boer was opprobriously
launched at those lovers of peace who tried to
defend their country’s foes from exaggerated blame.
It was skilfully handled to promote militant enthusiasm,
and discountenance all criticism of
militant action and feeling.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the emotional side of human nature inimical
effects of warfare were wholly disregarded, and
opinions on the subject of war given forth by a
so-called educated class of men and eagerly imbibed
by an ignorant public were confused, often
false and shamefully misleading. One of these
pseudo-teachers alleged that the wars of past
times indicated chronic disease, but militarism
in the present was useful, because in the home-life
of the nation the restraints of authority are
becoming weak (Capt. Mahan). And an eminent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>statesman announced his impression that the
South African war was “designed to build up those
moral qualities which are after all the only solid
and the only permanent foundation on which any
empire can be built”! (Mr. Balfour’s speech at
Manchester; <cite>Scotsman’s</cite> Report, January 9, 1900.)</p>

<p class='c004'>But the true method of judging an event is to
exercise comparison, taking into account a far
greater mass of social phenomena than that of
the immediate present. Now the careful study
of past history has proved that an outbreak of
militant fraternity, combined with indulgence in
the principle of enmity, leaves a society less fraternal
than before in regard to the labours of peace and
of building up; and against the claim that military
training is a good preparation for civic life there
lies the whole testimony of civilization. Further,
the survival of militancy frustrates the solving
of our great social problems, and the recent relapse
to the militarist ideal is a grave hindrance to that
social science which would provide the true ways
of humanizing defective types. (I refer my reader
for a fuller statement on these lines to Mr. J. M.
Robertson’s <cite>Patriotism and Empire</cite>.) “After
Waterloo,” says Mr. Robertson, “it seems to
have been realized by the intelligence of Europe
that militarism and imperialism had alike pierced
the hands that leant on them.” Nevertheless,
they reappeared, as we know, galvanized into
fatal activity in human affairs, at the close of the
nineteenth century.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>Again, the action of international capitalism
and the ideal of imperialism have been analysed
from the standpoint of social philosophy by
Mr. J. A. Hobson, an advanced and logical thinker
on economic questions. His conclusion is that
the driving forces of aggressive imperialism are
the organized influences of certain professional
and commercial classes which have definite economic
advantages to gain by assuming a spurious
patriotism, and the most potent of all these influences
emanates from the financier. The power
of financiers, exerted directly upon politicians
and indirectly through the press upon public
opinion, is, perhaps, so says Mr. Hobson, the most
serious problem in public life to-day.<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c015'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004'>It is not by sanguinary conflicts in which victory
turns on superior numbers, superior arms, and
superior cunning in military tactics, that a nation’s
greatness is built up at this period of the world’s
history. What progress demands is not more
of national wealth and international power; it
is a better system of industrial life and a finer type
of humanity—men and women of clear intellectual
insight, high moral courage, unselfish instincts
and humane sentiments guiltless of narrow exclusiveness.
These men and women, discerning
ideally the best methods of building up a nation’s
greatness <em>on the happiness of its people</em>, will aid
our half-civilized races to embody that ideal on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>the physical plane, and to educate their children
to live up to it and show forth all its beauty.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the mental basis of a high spiritual life even
now our children are a reproach, for here and
there they emit sparks indicative of embryonic
sentiment in advance of practice around them.
At the height of the Boer War a child in his nursery
on being told that his nurse was opening a tin
of boar’s head for breakfast, exclaimed, every
feature quivering with sudden disgust, “Catch
me eat my enemy’s head.”</p>

<p class='c004'>When a nation repudiates with similar disgust
that wholesale destruction of life, which is no whit
less evil than the cannibalism of an earlier date,
then will war and patriotism cease to be—their
place taken by a civilization standing firm on the
foundation of human happiness and love.</p>

<p class='c004'>Given such outward conditions of life as are
favourable to a freer exercise of the noblest social
attributes and impulses of man, and the ethical
temper will prevail. By ethical temper I mean
not only the absence of all animosities that engender
conflict, but the presence of a strong sense
of personal rights and an equally strong protectiveness
over the rights of others—a national impulse,
in short, to an equivalence of liberty and social
comfort for all mankind. But this justice is a
supremely complex emotion—the one of all others
that demands most of human capacity. It rests
upon mental development, i.e. a universal enlargement
of mind.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>Industrial changes there must be, but these
alone will not secure progress; we need <em>true
education</em>, for in the deeper strata of existence—the
region of feeling, the movements of change
must be guided from the old order to the new.
Hence the vital importance of moral education—an
education that will create an intelligent appreciation
of truth wherever presented, and bind all
men together in loyalty to truth.</p>

the second great human factor in man’s evolution,
viz. nurture or education, which depends in its
highest terms upon sound knowledge and the
application of that knowledge by men and women
of the period. In an advanced scientific age, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>reproductive forces of man will be socially controlled
and guided to the creation of normal, i.e. healthy,
physical life; while the whole apparatus of nurture,
or the entire range of influence, playing upon childhood,
will manifest a rational adaptation of means
to a special end, namely, the elevation of humanity.</p>

<p class='c004'>Adaptation necessarily becomes more difficult
with the growing complexities of evolving humanity,
but never has man’s intellect been stronger than
to-day to grapple with difficult problems, or so
furnished with the facts required in dealing with
this problem of education.</p>

<p class='c004'>The marvellous scientific discoveries of the nineteenth
century and the practical uses to which these
discoveries are put, have created in man a new
attitude towards external nature. All Western
nations partake of the scientific bent. They are
interpenetrated by reverence for science, and are
conscious that its method of close observation and
study of nature is the direct road to material progress.
This bent is influencing school education.
There are few thoughtful teachers to-day who do
not recognize that some hours spent at intervals in
country lanes and fields, on the sea-shore, or in a
farm-yard, with children free to observe according
to native impulse, when followed by careful instruction
concerning the objects observed, are of
far more value than weeks of book-learning indoors.</p>

<p class='c004'>In many parts of America “nature-studies” on
this plan are worked into the public school curriculum.<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c015'><sup>[6]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>But adaptation implies also a fuller knowledge
of the rudimentary faculties which are to be
scientifically nurtured, and here again America has
taken the lead. In its “child-study” movement,
now spreading in this country, an effort is made to
apprehend nature’s processes in unfolding mental
powers; and the inference is that teachers may
thwart progress by traversing the true order of
mental development. This clearly indicates the
entrance of a scientific spirit into the field of education.
It shows regard for the order of nature,
willingness to be guided by knowledge of that order,
and a conviction that the laws of a child’s inner
being must be respected and no arbitrary compulsion
exercised in bringing him into harmony with the
laws of the environment.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f6'>
<p class='c004'><a href='#r6'>6</a>. The schools of to-day are made more and more into
miniature worlds where children are taught how to live.
The actual industries of the world as well as its art galleries,
museums and parks are being utilized as part of public
school equipment. The children are taken to the shops,
the markets, the gardens, etc. <cite>The New Spirit of Education</cite>,
by Arthur Henry, <cite>Munsey’s Magazine</cite>, 1902.</p>
</div>

<p class='c004'>A child’s capacities, however, are not centred in
his intellect. On the passional side of his being, his
spontaneous impulses of desire, fear, joy, grief, love,
hatred, jealousy, etc., have to be studied, and
educative forces found for their guidance and
control. Moreover, the ultimate aim is not his
subjection to fixed rules of life, but the establishment
within the heart of the child of a supreme rule over
all his passions. And again, every child has characteristics
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>indicative of the course of development
undergone by the special race to which he belongs.
The geographical position and primitive industry
of that race, its conquests and failures in struggling
upwards from savagery to a measure of civilization—all
have left an impress in specific effects.</p>

<p class='c004'>In respect of our formal methods of giving
instruction there is much that is open to discussion;
but the points usually raised are the best means of
teaching grammar, history, geography, arithmetic,
and so forth, not the far more important question of
how best to achieve an all-round development in
face of the organic unity and marvellous multiplicity
of qualities in the child of a civilized race.
Great improvement has taken place in every branch
of school teaching both as regards the knowledge of
teachers and the methods they adopt in imparting
the knowledge; nevertheless, these improvements
are minor matters as compared with the general
question before us.</p>

<p class='c004'>During the rise and progress of our industrial
system based on individualism, the constant
fluctuations of trade, the competing of machinery
against human labour, the perpetual danger of
getting thrown out of work, the utter failure of
thrift as any protection from intermittent poverty—have
been factors eminently calculated to produce
a highly nervous type of humanity. Children of
that type may happily prove bright and eager amid
wretched surroundings, but it were folly to expect
them to show any impulse towards a high standard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>of living, any outlook beyond the immediate present,
or any inherent check upon action socially immoral.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the other hand, our city workers have sprung
mainly from an agricultural class whose scattered
families presented the defects of a low order of life
reared in isolation. Many of these defects have
been counteracted by segregation within towns,
however unfavourable in other directions that may
have proved. The close proximity of beings
affected by the same fateful conditions, the actual
sorrowing and rejoicing together have expanded
the emotional nature and engendered true sympathy.
Professor Huxley once said, “It is futile to expect a
hungry and squalid population to be anything but
violent and gross.” Yet we have an immense
population of workers, often hungry, and at all times
environed more or less by squalor, whose average
character is not violent and gross, but distinctly
humane.</p>

<p class='c004'>Turning from the masses to the classes we find
some points of difference between the rich and the
poor, viz. differences following from the diverse
industrial conditions. Leisure, as commanded by
the rich, has made mental development possible
wherever desire prompted intellectual effort, and
the magnificent record of last century’s achievements
in discovery of truth, acquisition of knowledge, and
promotion of artistic skill, is a gain to the world at
large—a gain made possible by accumulation of
wealth unequally distributed. But intellectual
faculty has frequently been depraved through its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>devotion to wealth production. The true aims of
life are lost sight of by chiefs of industry whose
emotional nature has hardened under the daily
spectacle of struggling fellow-beings, on whose labour
their fortunes are built up. The dignity of useful
labour has had no vogue in general education. An
opposite principle—that the highest dignity consists
in being served by others and in possessing
the means of constraining and exploiting the labour
of others, is impressed on the children of our
classes by the whole play of circumstance around
them. The property-sense has become unduly
developed, and a selfish mammon-worship holds the
place which an altruistic public spirit ought to hold
in the inner life of a civilized people. It is true that
a showy charity—a patronage by the rich of the
poor—is everywhere present throughout society, but
that which creates and supports it is a sentiment
wholly different from the simple kindness of the
poor to the poor. It is without the essential features
of that charity that “vaunteth not itself, is not puffed
up, seeketh not her own&#160;... thinketh no evil.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Now the scientific spirit of to-day, in observing
the uncontrolled play of middle-class children, has
discovered how great is their interest and joy in the
spontaneous exercise of the faculty of make-believe.
Costly toys will readily be thrown aside to take part
in a game of “pretended” housekeeping or shopkeeping,
or acting the part of father, mother, nursemaid,
or cook. And herein there lies, says one of
our advanced teachers, “a powerful hint how to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>keep children’s attention alive while cultivating
to the utmost their imaginative, observing, constructive
and correlating faculties. We must dramatize
our school education and connect school ideally
with real life.” (Mr. Howard Swan; his introductory
lecture at the opening of Bedford Park School.)</p>

<p class='c004'>But the “powerful hint” goes deeper. It points
to an instinct or a deeply implanted desire and
capacity for actual work on the part of children of
a practical race. To play at work is pleasurable,
to do work more pleasurable still. Yet in blindness
to the fact that in drawing out into action every
rudimentary faculty favourable to happy life lies the
true path of education or an all-round development,
society has shut off middle and upper-class children
from the sight and hearing of household labour. In
nurseries, amid artificial toys, their daily routine is
to seek amusement self-centred; and as in these
days of small rather than large families, nursery
children are often solitary, there is a systematic
repression both of natural activities and infolded
natural emotions. The same repressions are carried
forward into school life. Dramatized teaching may
connect school ideally with real life, but it cannot
satisfy a child’s cravings for the real, and the
companionship of children of similar age will never
call out the complex forces of a many-sided emotional
nature. It is not playing at life that is
required for education, it is the sharing of life’s
duties of service, and constant opportunity given
for the practice of varied humanities.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>The children of our superior workers may perchance
fare better if the mother is a capable woman,
and the home not overcrowded. The lighter parts
of her work are shared by the little ones, and to help
mother in sweeping and dusting, washing cups and
saucers, and placing them neatly in the cupboard,
etc., are not only interesting and useful occupations,
they are educative, for they imply a simultaneous
training of the eye, the fingers, the mental faculties
and the heart. But overcrowding, the miserable
housing of the poor, and the early age at which
infant school-life begins, makes such home-training
difficult even to the best of mothers, while to the
upper classes—frost-bound in artificial domestic
customs, all home-training seems impossible.</p>

<p class='c004'>Nothing, however, should deter a student of
evolution from proclaiming that the home-life of our
people will largely decide the nation’s future.
Unless the great problem of the housing of the poor
is rightly solved, and unless educated women become
roused to the necessity of a changed home-life in the
interests of their children, and set themselves voluntarily
to the task of domestic reform within their
own circle, the social state can never be greatly
improved.</p>

<p class='c004'>All children born in a civilized nation have a right
to education. That this principle has been fully
acknowledged is evidenced by our Educational Acts
and the innumerable Board Schools that stud the
country. But as long as population among the
masses rises without check, the highest aim of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>education, viz. the development and elevation of
individual character must, as regards their children,
remain in abeyance. The only practicable line of
action is to gather them together into large schools,
and while bestowing general instruction in reading,
writing, arithmetic, etc., to subject them to some
hours of systematic guidance and control. This
signifies obedience to rule and order—a useful
discipline to juveniles of Bohemian nature, and it is
the only method of restraining tendencies to licence,
without rousing a spirit of revolt. Fresh air, wholesome
food, ample bathing, and the play of sunlight
and colour upon nerves of sensation—these stimulate
bodily health, while music, and the personal
influence of high-minded teachers, throw into
vibration finer nerves of sensibility, and elevate the
mental and moral tone. But beyond this point,
large schools are incapable of scientific adaptation
to the needs of a modern education in a rapidly
socializing community.</p>

<p class='c004'>It was in the year 1837 that there issued from the
press a work on education written by Isaac Taylor,
who there lays down this proposition: “If large
schools were granted to be generally better adapted
to the practical ends of education than private
instruction, the welfare of society on the whole
demands also the other method. The school-bred
man is of one sort, the home-bred man of another—the
community has need of both. Hence no
tyranny of fashion is more to be resisted than such
as would render a public education compulsory and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>universal.”<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c015'><sup>[7]</sup></a> Notwithstanding this warning, the
tyranny of fashion is carrying us yearly more and
more into the production of school-bred women, as
well as school-bred men. Our girls’ high schools
are replicas of our boys’ public schools, and society
suffers still more from the loss of the home-bred
woman than the home-bred man.</p>

</div>

<p class='c004'>Again, the late Professor D’Arcy W. Thompson,
in his charmingly-written <cite>Day-dreams of a Schoolmaster</cite>,
gives us the fruits of a ripe experience gained
during twelve years of boyhood in a large public
school, and many years of manhood as teacher of
classics in schools and university. His boyhood,
he tells us, was dreary because of the monotonous
routine. He was “fed on dull books, and the
manuals were in many cases mere tramways to
pedantry. His mental training was a continuous
sensation of obstruction and pain. His spiritual parts
were furrowed.” (Observe, there were no nature-studies
at that period.) The incitement to effort
was the cane or the tawse, and flogging, he believes,
never instils courage, it has transformed many a
boy into a sneak. “Let us discard punishment,”
says the Professor, “and endeavour to make our
pupils <em>love</em> work.” The whole educational system in
his day was mechanical and artificial, yet when he
strove to initiate new methods the boys were withdrawn
from his charge. Parents understood little
of true education. They were slaves to custom.
“How is it,” he asks, “that fathers with a personal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>experience like my own send their boys to school?”
He answers: “They say to themselves, ‘Depend
upon it if there were no virtue in birching and
caning, in Latin verses and Greek what-you-may-call-’ems,
they would not have held their ground so
long amongst a practical people like ourselves!’
So Johnnie is sent to the town grammar school and
the great time-honoured gerund-stone turns as
before, and will turn to the last syllable of recorded
time.” For the gerund-stone he would substitute
an easy <i><span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">vivâ voce</span></i> conversational method of instruction
in all elementary classes, and throughout the
school; for coercion, the more than hydraulic
pressure of a persistent, continuous gentleness.</p>

<p class='c004'>Thirty years before the <cite>Day-dreams</cite> was published,
one writer at least was open-eyed to the defects of
school education. He charged parents with adopting
the new boarding-school system because it
spared them some responsibility, and children were
apt to be teasing and importunate. “Boys advance
at school quickly,” he said, “in knowledge of the
auxiliary verbs, the mysteries of syntax and the
stories of gods and goddesses; but I am confident
that the reason why women generally are so much
better disposed than men is this: they live domestically
and familiarly. They are penetrated with the
home-spirit, they are imbued with all its influences,
their memory is not fed to plethora while the heart
is left to waste and perish. No daughter of mine
shall ever be sent to school; at home the heart,
wherein are the issues of all good, develops itself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>from day to day. There children ripen in their
affections. There they learn their humanities, not
in the academic sense, but in the natural and true
one.”<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c015'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c004'><a href='#r8'>8</a>. <cite>Self-Formation</cite>, by Capel Lofft, vol. 1, p. 42.</p>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Where, alas! do we find to-day the daughters of
the classes who are not sent to school? Our girls’
high schools overflow; and that, not by the action
of State control, but by the voluntarily assumed
yoke and tyranny of fashion. Girls emerging from
these schools are not “so much better disposed
than men.” They are certainly not domesticated
and imbued with a home-spirit. They may have
gained in refinement—even to fastidiousness! and
in the knowledge of Latin and Greek, or what is
called the higher culture, but they are characterized
generally by a spirit of pleasure-seeking. They
become, in many cases, what has aptly been called
“nonsense women, prepared only to lead butterfly
lives.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Now, parents who shirk the responsibility and
effort entailed in shaping their children’s characters
to the best of their ability can only expect their own
self-indulgence to become intensified in the lives of
their children. Let me not, however, be here misunderstood.
The movement for the higher education
of women is a step forward in civilization.
Many women are born with great mental capacity,
and without the specific intellectual culture now
obtainable the world would lose much, while the nonexercise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>of such native powers creates inward misery.
But culture, according to Matthew Arnold, implies
the study of perfection, and the late Professor
Huxley’s ideal is expressed as follows:—“That man
has had a liberal education who has been so trained
in youth that his body is the ready servant of his
will, and does with ease and pleasure all the work
that as a mechanism it is capable of; whose intellect
is clear, with all its parts of equal strength
and in smooth working order; whose mind is stored
with a knowledge of the great and fundamental
truths of Nature and of the laws of her operations;
one who—no stunted ascetic—is full of life and fire,
but whose passions are trained to come to heel by a
vigorous will, the servant of a tender conscience;
who has learnt to love all beauty, to hate all vileness,
and to respect others as himself. Such an one and
no other has had a liberal education, for he is as
completely as man can be in harmony with nature.”
(An Address at South London Working Men’s
College, January, 1869.)</p>

<p class='c004'>Childhood is characterized by sensational activity.
The reflective and reasoning powers lie comparatively
dormant. Mobile sensibility is the distinguishing
feature of childhood, and parents and
teachers taking advantage of the law of nature
whereby pleasurable sensation stimulates growth
should train children step by step to the enjoyment
of <em>useful</em> activities, to physical and manual dexterity;
to simple efforts in pursuit of knowledge; to
infantile firmness in discharge of duty; to unconstrained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>dignity in defence of the right, and sympathetic
jealousy over the rights of others; to gentleness
towards all mankind; to admiration of all that
is noble in character, to veneration of age, experience
and virtue; and to the love of truth and justice and
personal devotion to both. These are the qualities
of human nature that make for real civilization;
and further progress requires their steady development
in the race.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now, these qualities cannot be evoked by school
methods nor even by the easy <i><span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">vivâ voce</span></i> conversational
instruction proposed by Professor Thompson. An
indispensable factor in the process is a rich, full,
domestic environment, an atmosphere suffused
with affection and vibrating with varied activities—<em>a
home-life</em>, in short, where the delicate qualities of
noble character will not be commanded to come
forth, but will come of themselves through the play
of circumstance, i.e. by the action of example and
gentle sympathetic co-operation.</p>

<p class='c004'>In upper-class houses, even where wealth and
luxury abound, there are none of the diverse and
liberal domestic surroundings conducive to early
training. The first essential is that the nurseries
be freed from all physical, mental and moral forces
that belong to a comparatively primitive stage of
evolution. Nurses drawn from the masses—however
carefully selected—are incompetent by nurture
for training infants in the best way. The authority
they have known has been archaic, and elements of
barbarism have been near them from babyhood,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>while education as yet has done little to raise their
intelligence to the plane of civilized thought.
Hence an ordinary nurse, of kindly and affectionate
disposition, may seriously misdirect the
budding conscience of a babe, as I have shown in
my chapters on Emotional Life.</p>

<p class='c004'>To women of great attainments and culture the
training of infancy properly belongs, and that training
in the homes of the classes will be of the highest
value to the State. The problem of how to create
in childhood a ready obedience to authority without
jarring the nerves, or checking freedom unnecessarily,
is a very difficult one. It requires a cultured
intelligence to grasp the problem and carry out the
true method of its solution. The aim in the training
of infancy is to develop superior types of men and
women by evoking the higher qualities of human
nature <em>in a sphere of comparative liberty</em>. A babe in
the nursery, let us say, has had his attention caught
by the flames leaping up in the well-guarded grate.
He creeps towards them and pushes his fingers
through the wires of the guard. The educated
nurse gently lifts him to a safe distance, but he starts
creeping again to the fire. Now there are in the
nursery some baskets of different size and depth, all
softly lined and weighted. Baby is put into one of
these to amuse himself with a toy until the fascinating
flames are forgotten.</p>

<p class='c004'>An older child flings her ball in another child’s
face. Nurse tells her the ball might hurt, but on
persistence in the selfish amusement she, too, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>firmly placed in a larger basket or nursery prison,
and must stay there till the impulse to be disobedient
has passed off; for the principle which
guides nurse in the training of these infants is this:
liberty abused must be abridged.</p>

<p class='c004'>After a few such experiences the little ones feel
that a network is around them—a network of
authority never physically painful and that has no
connection with anger.</p>

<p class='c004'>As the reasoning powers develop they feel that
liberty is theirs in the straight course of obedience
to authority, and later they find that this authority
represents a knowledge of the laws of nature, for
when in garden and field they join in the nature-study
lessons, they discover that if plants creep
into unfavourable conditions, they languish; if
animals run counter to laws of health, they suffer
and die.</p>

<p class='c004'>From nursery to home-training the infants pass
forward. Their nerves have never been irritated
by harshness, nor their affections repressed, and
their impulses to unhurtful activities are of normal
strength. In the more advanced training now
given, the aim is no longer to impress automatically,
but rationally to guide the growing intelligence.
Blind obedience is not required, but every command
is explained and related to the facts of happy and
healthful life. At this point a discriminating
judgment is profoundly necessary, and the child
should be studied individually, for to each there
comes the right moment when self-rule is possible,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>and unless outward restraints are wisely withdrawn
that power of self-rule may be injured.</p>

<p class='c004'>The human types to be desired are not slavish,
but independent beings, capable of noble service to
God and man; and choosing to do right because
they know true happiness lies that way.</p>

<p class='c004'>At sixteen or upwards the young thus trained may
safely leave home for high school or university, in
pursuit of the special instruction required for their
future career. An education that has laid the
foundation of noble character, comes to no abrupt
conclusion. The love of truth when firmly implanted
prompts to the acquisition of new knowledge,
and knowledge is boundless as the universe.
Fields of science become the happy hunting-ground
of minds that are markedly intellectual, and although
self-culture supersedes formal instruction, and
original research supersedes the following of authority,
education moves continuously and steadily
forward.</p>

<p class='c004'>“The environment,” says Clifford Harrison,
“that lies open to men rationally developed is as
vast as the ideal that lies before them. This
environment is not a spiritual matter merely; not
of the soul alone, but of body, mind, soul and spirit;
not of heaven only, but of earth as well; not of
eternity and a beyond, but of time and here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Adolescence is a critical period in the life of an
individual. At that period, character, speaking
generally, fully manifests, and the life is decided for
good or evil. What advanced ethics requires is
that each adult generation should deliberately
examine its inheritance from the previous, less
conscious, less informed epoch, in order to detect
and destroy every social snare that entangles unwary
feet in adolescence; and to devise the best methods
of bringing to the young the wisdom and sympathy
of their seniors.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the autobiography of the late Anthony Trollope
(vol. 1, p. 69), some facts of his own adolescence
are stated in a spirit as generous as it is candid.
His fate, like that of thousands of young men in his
day, and in the present day, was to live at that critical
time in a town, surrounded by all the attractions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>that a keen competitive commercialism has created
to supplement profits—though at the expense of
young men’s money and morals—and with no private
retreat save a solitary lodging, a shelter, but in no
sense a home. “No allurement to decent respectability,”
he says, “came in my way.” For the spending
of his evenings, the choice lay between what he
calls “questionable resorts” and sitting alone
reading or drinking tea. “There was no house
in which I could habitually see a lady’s face and hear
a lady’s voice, and in these circumstances the temptations
of loose life will almost certainly prevail with
a young man; at any rate they prevailed with me.”<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c015'><sup>[9]</sup></a>
Similar evidence may be found in a realistic, powerful
novel, <cite>Jude the Obscure</cite>. Mr. Thomas Hardy
there depicts the tragedy of unfulfilled aims, the
shipwreck of what might have been a noble life;
and the cause of shipwreck is pointed out in the
words of the dying Jude: “My impulses and affections
were too strong&#160;... a man without advantages
should be as cold-blooded as a fish and as
selfish as a pig to have a really good chance of being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>one of his country’s worthies.” Now, affection
and the impulse to love purely can never be too strong
for the interests of general evolution, therefore we
are entitled to assume that the environment is at
fault. The fact that thousands of young men deprived
of healthy home-life succumb to the temptations
of city-life, condemns our industrial competition.
Public consciousness has not grasped the needs
and dangers of adolescence, and the slowly evolving
community-conscience disregards the terrible penalty
paid in general degradation for retaining a system
of industry that produces among other evils “questionable
resorts where young men see life in false,
delusive colours.” These and all other injurious
outcomes of our tragic struggle for the necessaries
and amenities of life, will persist until the individualistic
system of industry disappears, i.e. is superseded
by a rational collectivist system. Standing as we
do on the verge of conscious evolution, that time is
not yet, but something may be done by parents and
guardians of youth to counteract the evils of a
transitional epoch.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f9'>
<p class='c004'><a href='#r9'>9</a>. More recently still the world has been afforded a glance
into the inner history of a life destined to noble uses and high
achievements. In the meridian of his fame Professor
Huxley wrote thus to Charles Kingsley: “Kicked into the
world a boy without guide or training, or with worse than
none, I confess to my shame that few men have drunk deeper
of all kinds of sin than I. Happily my course was arrested
in time—before I had earned absolute destruction—and
for long years I have been slowly and painfully climbing,
with many a fall, towards better things.”—<cite>Life of Professor
Huxley</cite>, vol. 1, p. 220.</p>

<p class='c004'>Progress in an evolving society largely depends
upon true union, i.e. mental, emotional and spiritual
union of the sexes. But a careful examination of
the prominent movements in society, and especially
the various divisions of the woman’s emancipation
movement, reveals that all are defective through
inattention to this fundamental need. They do not
aim at social conditions in which solidarity of heart
and soul will naturally ensue.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>The woman movement is the issue in great
measure of pent-up forces of youth in the female
sex of the upper classes. It is less the revolt of
labour against poverty, injustice, and overtaxed
strength, than a revolt from enforced idleness on the
part of the victims of wealth. The position is
graphically put before us by the late Charles Reade
in his amusing tale <cite>The Woman Hater</cite>.</p>

<p class='c004'>Fanny Dover, a common enough type of upper-class
femininity, appears to the woman-hater a mere
shallow-minded, selfish coquette, till suddenly at an
unexpected emergency she assumes new and very
different colours. “How is this?” he exclaims.
“You were always a bright girl and no fool, but not
exactly what humdrum people call good&#160;... you
are not offended?” “The idea,” says Fanny,
“why I have publicly denounced goodness again
and again.” “Yes, and yet you turn out as good as
gold!... I have watched you; you are all over
the house to serve two suffering women. You are
cook, housemaid, nurse and friend to both of them.
In an interval of your time so creditably employed
you cheer me up with your bright little face and give
me wise advice! Explain the phenomenon.” “My
dear Harrington, if you cannot read so shallow a
character as I am, how will you get on with those
ladies upstairs&#160;... but there, I will have pity on
you. You shall understand one woman before you
die&#160;... give me a cigarette.... What women love
and can’t do without if they are young and spirited,
is excitement. I am one who pines for it. Society
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>is so constructed that to get excitement you must
be naughty. Waltzing&#160;... flirting, etc., are excitement,&#160;... dining <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en famille</span></i>, going to bed at
ten, etc., are stagnation; good girls mean stagnant
girls; I hate and despise these tame little wretches;
I never was one and never will be. But look here,
we have two ladies in love with one villain—that is
exciting. One gets nearly killed in the house—that
is gloriously exciting; the other is broken-hearted.
If I were to be a bad girl and say: ‘It is not my
business; I will leave them to themselves and go
my little mill-round of selfishness as before, why
what a fool I must be! I should lose excitement.
Instead of that I run and get things for the Klosking—excitement.
I cook for her and nurse her and sit
up half the night—excitement. Then I run to Zoe
and do my best for her or get snubbed—excitement.
Then I sit at the head of your table and
order you—excitement. Oh! it is lovely.’ ‘Shall
you be sorry when they both get well and routine
re-commences?’ Of course I shall; that is the sort
of good girl I am.”</p>

<p class='c004'>This youthful exuberance or restlessness is favourable
to social advance, and the woman movement
has accomplished good service in claiming and turning
it to useful account. But here, as in all partial
reforms, new evils dog the footsteps of the new good
effected. To-day we have numerous city workers
of the female as well as the male sex, compelled by
the exigencies of their labour to live far apart from
their nearest and dearest, in solitary lodgings like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>Anthony Trollope, or at best in the make-believe
homes limited to inmates of one sex. I do not
infer that these girls fall under any special temptations
to licence, but, deprived as they are of the
immediate influences of early associations and the
subtle tendernesses of home-life, I hold it impossible
that their emotional human nature should not suffer
loss. Their need for the happy and useful exercise
of activities which were running into mischievous
courses, is satisfactorily met, but at the expense of
domestic traits, and these are precisely what lie
at the root of human fellowship—that union of
heart and soul which is indispensable to true
progress.</p>

<p class='c004'>Some social reformers regard the higher education
of women movement as a potent factor in
uniting men and women through the mutual interests
of cultured thought. A knowledge, however, of
Greek, Latin, the classics, etc., accomplishes little
so long as the sexes are not educated together, and
this form of culture has no <em>direct</em> bearing on elevation
of character and development of the emotional side
of human nature. Cricket, golf, and all our fashionable
out-door sports have done more, in creating
mutual interests and furthering progress by securing
for girls greater social freedom than was previously
theirs, and Mr. H. W. Massingham spoke truly when
he said: “No special complications have followed
in any marked degree the vast extension that has
taken place in the field of girls’ free companionship
with men. Yet what would our fathers have thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>of it?”<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c015'><sup>[10]</sup></a> But sports are for the hours of leisure,
and ample leisure belongs only to the idle or to a
minor section of female workers. Meanwhile we
have thousands of young women, of different calibre
to Fanny Dover, whose noblest attribute, viz. their
innate capacity for all the finer vibrations of social
feeling, is never called into play.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f10'>
<p class='c004'><a href='#r10'>10</a>. <cite>Ethical World</cite>, June, 1900.</p>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Amid all the kaleidoscopic scenes of our transition
period, a new figure of womanhood has undoubtedly
appeared—a type not characterized by frivolity
or love of excitement, but by strenuousness, sincerity,
refinement, moral courage, a will-force in
short, that breaking through selfish limitations
seeks nobler spheres of action. This will-force is
subject to constant recoil. It is thrown back on
itself by adverse conditions of society, of industry,
of private individual life.</p>

<p class='c004'>In <cite>Jude the Obscure</cite> this new type of woman is
skilfully sketched. Susan Bridehead is a creature
of high aspiration, rich inward resources and manifold
imperfections. She has foibles and feminine
vanities, but the human nature is essentially large-minded,
generous, truthful. “I did not flirt,” she
says to Jude, “but a craving to attract and captivate,
regardless of the injury it might do, was in me&#160;...
my liking for you is not as some women’s perhaps,
but it is a delight in being with you of a supremely
delicate kind&#160;... I did want and long to ennoble
some man to high aims.” Here we have love transferred
from the lower reaches of pure sensation to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>a higher level of tender sentiment, and energized
from the intellectual plane. This denotes a slow evolution
of ages during which all the grossness, i.e. the
coarser vibrations of primitive love, are transmuted
into the finer vibrations of sympathetic, altruistic
feeling.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is important to see clearly the distinction
between primitive and modern love, in order that
no confusion may arise in contemplating the ideal
social life that scientific meliorism forecasts. The
intrinsic quality of primitive love is illustrated in
Mrs. Bishop’s description of her favourite horse’s
attachment. “I am to him an embodiment of
melons, cucumbers, grapes, pears, peaches, biscuits
and sugar, with a good deal of petting and ear-rubbing
thrown in!” Human attachments based
on these pleasurable sensations or simple animal
appetites and passions, form the main soldering
ingredients in humanity’s mass; but love’s development
has marched concurrently with true civilization,
and to men and women in the van of civilization
one chief cause of misery to-day is repression of the
normal, healthy impulse to pure and unselfish love.</p>

<p class='c004'><em>Unselfishness</em> is the distinguishing feature of
higher forms of love, and an unselfishness that had
its origin not in conjugal union but in motherhood.
Mr. Finck, in his study of love’s evolution, puts it
thus: “The helpless infant could not survive
without a mother’s self-sacrificing care, hence there
was an important use for womanly sympathy which
caused it to survive and grow while man immersed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>in wars and struggles remained hard of heart and
knew not tenderness.... Selfishness in a man is
perhaps less offensive because competition and the
struggle for existence necessarily foster it.” (Henry
Finck’s <cite>Primitive Love</cite>, pp. 160–161.) The social
need for a specialized unselfishness has tended to
differentiate the sexes emotionally, and in process of
building up the entire structure of social life the
pressure of outward forces has carried this differentiation
further. I am not then traversing the natural
laws of evolution when I assume that all questions
relating to women are at this date pre-eminently
important.</p>

<p class='c004'>The population problem, as I have shown, can
only be solved through a diminution of the birth-rate,
and throughout the British nation the family
group is breaking up. It is disintegrating especially
in the upper and middle classes.</p>

<p class='c004'>The movement towards industrial socialism is
the outcome of masculine thought and energy. Man
is its mainspring, although many thoughtful women
take part in it. Conversely, the house-ruler, woman,
must be the mainspring of a movement towards
domestic socialism, although no success will accrue
without the steadfast aid and co-operation of man.
That some women are already fitted to begin this
great work is evident from much of our female
public service. Let me quote some words recently
spoken of lady-workers by a male critic, Mr.
H. W. Massingham: “They have moral courage and
refinement. They do not tire more easily than men;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>they do not shirk the detail work; they take to
drudgery.” Pioneers of the new movement must be
religious in the best sense, i.e. their philosophy must
bring into touch the worlds seen and unseen, inspiring
action conducive to personal and universal happiness.</p>

<p class='c004'>The task before them is of double intent, viz.
of immediate utility and of far-reaching benefit. It
will attract inferior natures as well as the superior,
for a well-organized modern home will present more
convenience, comforts and embellishments than the
family homes of the past or present, and at smaller
expense. Herein a certain danger lurks. Pioneers
will have to guard against dropping out of the
enterprise its supreme purpose and main evolutional
value, viz. the raising humanity on to higher levels
of happiness. There is no other policy to this end
than that of domestically uniting the sexes from
infancy, in order that in the idealistic period of
adolescence soul may meet soul with fearless unreserve
and young men and women realize by
experience that in the pure realms of thought and
feeling the closest union is possible. It is this union
manifesting in dual sympathy that will become the
liberating force of the world, and in it and through
it woman’s emancipation will be complete.</p>

  <h3 class='c005'>CHAPTER II<br /> <span class='large'>DOMESTIC REFORM</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The animating spring of all improvement in individuals
and in societies is not the knowledge of the actual but the
conception of the possible.—<span class='sc'>H. Martineau.</span></p>

<p class='c018'>How shall the new era be inaugurated? By ceasing to
strive for self and family; by thinking of both only as
instruments of the common weal.—<span class='sc'>Prof. A. W. Bickerton.</span></p>

<p class='c008'>The model family home of the British middle class
half a century ago comprised a father and mother
of sound constitution and domestic habits with a
group of children of both sexes—a group large
enough to supply companionship to one another,
and a family income sufficient for comfortable
maintenance and recreation, occasional travel and
the free exercise of hospitality. If homes of this
type were widely and firmly established throughout
the land they might be competent to breed, nurture
and send forth into the world a good average material
of human life for repairing waste and building up
the British nation. But in the present epoch such
homes are exceedingly rare, and the trend of social
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>forces and modern ideas alike make for their becoming
still rarer.</p>

<p class='c004'>To speak only of the more obvious factors of
change, State action in reference to the education
of the young lifts children of the masses at almost
an infantile age out of the effective control of
family life, and in our centres of national industry
economic forces bring about a hasty pairing and
breeding, with an abrupt scattering of the brood
that resembles the nesting of birds rather than the
home-making of rational beings; while so immature
are the heads of these evanescent family homes that
the break-up is by no means an unmitigated evil.</p>

<p class='c004'>Among the classes, forces of a higher, more penetrative
order are working similarly. Prudence is
acting towards the restraint of population in a
manner that narrows the basis of family groups
and shortens the natural term of their existence;
and under a new impulse of right reason and high
resolve the educated section of the female sex is
deliberately forsaking the domestic hearth to share
the world’s labour with man. These concurrent
movements in society are destroying family life
on the old lines, and by the homes of the present,
individual needs are met only temporarily and provisionally.</p>

<p class='c004'>One conspicuous result is an ever-increasing
discomfort to the aged. They are stranded in homes
become empty, or wander abroad seeking touch
with their kind. Distinctly are they shunted off
the rails of busy life before a lowered vitality
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>prompts to inertia. The British “Philistine”
lacks sentiment. Old age makes no special appeal
to him, and he is content to bestow on relatives
no longer young a brief moment of his precious
time, a fragment of his tenderness. At an earlier
stage of our social evolution the mature in years
were centres of a rich, full, domestic life, and pivots
on which turned the wider social life encircling it.
At the present stage of that evolution the young
and the comparatively young focus and absorb the
whole sunshine of life, while the guardians of their
infancy pass into declining years enveloped in
gloom.</p>

<p class='c004'>This premature effacement entails on society
a double loss—first, the loss interiorly of that individual
happiness which intensifies and raises the
tide of life; second, the loss of activities guided by
and based upon <em>mellow experience</em>.</p>

<p class='c004'>Society is too materialistic to recognize that
human beings physically on the down-grade may
be psychically on the up-grade, and pre-eminently
fitted to inspire and promote progress. But in thinking
of latent possibilities realizable in a better
environment we are bound not to judge by average
humanity, but by the superior types of the preceding
generation. The old age of W. E. Gladstone,
Harriet Martineau, Mary Somerville, and others
was neither gloomy nor unproductive. The last-mentioned
at the age of eighty-one turned her
attention to writing a book on microscopic science.
“I seemed,” she says, “to resume the perseverance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>and energy of my youth. I began it with courage,
though I did not think I could live to finish it.”
She did, however, finish it, and lived to the age of
ninety-two, maintaining at all times her habits of
study and a full social intercourse with many friends.
(From <cite>Personal Recollections</cite>, by her Daughter.)</p>

<p class='c004'>It is not intellectual powers only that are running
to waste. Under the double pressure of competition
in trade and competition in the labour market,
good manual workers are found ineffective and
dismissed at an earlier age than formerly.</p>

<p class='c004'>An immense mass of our industrial population
is forced by circumstance into the workhouse when
still comparatively active, and life there is but a
gloomy vacant existence—a complete suppression
of the best faculties of body and mind.</p>

<p class='c004'>Comparing the past with the present in respect
of the old age of workers, we are told by Professor
Thorold Rodgers that village homes were centres
of multifarious occupations, in which naturally the
aged, if able, would take part. And in towns,
although streets were narrow, at the rear of the
houses there were gardens where old and young
together spent the long summer evenings. “Not
long ago,” says the American Social Science Committee
Report of 1878, “the farm found constant
employment for the men of the family—the women
had abundant employment in the home, there was
carding, spinning, weaving.” “And the neverending
labour of our grandmothers must not be
forgotten, who with nimble needle knit our stockings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>and mittens. The knitting-needle was in as constant
play as their tongues, whose music only ceased
under the power of sleep.... Now no more does
the knitting-needle keep time to the music of their
tongues, for the knitting-machine in the hands of
one little girl will do more work than fifty grandmothers.
Labour-saving machinery has broken up
and destroyed our whole system of household and
family manufacture, when all took part in the labour
and shared in the product to the comfort of all.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The system that has superseded that of “household
and family manufacture” has been adverse
to the aged from the first, and neglect of old age
has become a wrong-doing that eats like a canker
into our social life.</p>

<p class='c004'>As Professor Bickerton well remarks: “Unhappiness
is the disease of social life, and misery is an
indication that there is something wrong with our
social system. Just as it is unreasonable to expect
bodily health under insanitary conditions, so we cannot
look for social concord and joy unless mankind
be placed in circumstances that suit his social nature.
Man has been considered too exclusively as a producing
machine with subsidiary mental capacity,
whereas he is essentially a moral being with deep
emotions and universal sympathies. The cure for
the uncleanliness of society is not difficult. The
plans for the edifice of human life are obtainable.
What are the plans? Those laws of nature which
are concerned in the development of mankind.
What is the cure? Such understanding of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>principles of evolution and such consonant action
as shall restore to the race an environment befitting
its humanity.” (<cite>The Romance of the Earth.</cite>)</p>

<p class='c004'>Nevertheless, we cannot return to a system of
household and family manufacture. To relinquish
mechanical aids to production would be contrary
to, not consonant with, evolution. A civilized race
outgrows its primitive conditions of life and industry—new
wine must be put into new bottles.</p>

<p class='c004'>The immediate step of advance as regards manual
labour is this—in our centres of local administration
there should be organized municipal employment
with shortened hours for elderly people, the wage
to be supplemented by pensions ample enough to
secure for these workers an honourable social standing
instead of a pauper’s dole. But a closer adaptation
to humanity’s needs may be quickly achieved
by the classes where poverty plays a less part in the
social phenomena. Of present conditions Mr. Escott,
in his <cite>England, its People, Polity and Pursuits</cite>,
thus speaks: “The nation is only an aggregate of
households. Modern society is possessed by a
nomadic spirit which is the sure destroyer of home
ties. The English aristocracy flit from mansion to
mansion during the country-house season; they
know no peace during the London season. Existence
for the wealthy is one unending whirl of excitement,
admitting small opportunity for the cultivation of
the domestic affections. The claims of society have
continually acquired precedence of the duties of
home.”</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>In the middle class, however, wedged in between
the rich and the poor, the greatest factor of change
is the servant difficulty, and this difficulty we must
glance at in its causal relations.</p>

<p class='c004'>Civilized communities divide broadly into two
parts—productive units whose labour supplies what
is needful for existence, and unproductive units
whose existence depends on the labour of others.
The latter have been correctly termed “parasites.”
M. Jean Massart explains in his scientific scrutiny
of social phenomena,<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c015'><sup>[11]</sup></a> that during the period of our
industrial development a force of integration has
gradually strengthened the main body of the social
organism, giving it power to resist in some degree
the burden of parasitism. Consequently arbitrary
authority and slavish subserviency have abated,
and two movements affecting family life in the middle
class are discernible—first, there is an increasing
revolt from domestic service as a form of labour
directly opposed to the spirit of independence that
is growing in workers and to the force of integration
which by ranging them shoulder to shoulder is
preparing them for a new form of industrial life;
second, sons of the aristocracy and daughters of the
middle class are joining the ranks of producers
with some sense of the dignity of labour and the
degradation of a purely parasitic existence. Social
parasitism is not organic. It is an extraneous condition
induced in a society developing its civilization.
No man is necessarily a parasite; he acquires the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>character in the course of his life history, and happily
the young are refusing to acquire it.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f11'>
<p class='c004'><a href='#r11'>11</a>. <cite>Parasitism, Organic and Social</cite>, p. 121.</p>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Observe, then, it is not in one or two sections of
our community life, but in all sections that diverse
causes are producing one uniform result—the break-up
of the family home; and behind all the more
superficial causes there is working a profound factor
of change in the centripetal or constructive and the
centrifugal or destructive forces of nature. Whilst
the latter destroys old forms, the former prepares for
the new form—prepares, not only by an integration
of workers, but by a fresh inspiration of love and
desire for work. Hence women and men endowed
with reason, knowledge and practical skill may
bring the life of their own immediate circle into
express and positive line with this constructive,
profoundly evolutional, movement.</p>

<p class='c004'>Domestic reform implies the relinquishment of
that whole system of household labour that requires
the combination of a subject with a parasitic class.
Co-operation among equals takes the place of
masterful authority and slavish subjection, and
heavy labour will be relieved by scientific appliance.
Labour-saving contrivances in family homes hardly
exist. There has been little spur to invention on
these lines. But, as in industrial fields, a saving of
money, material and labour by the use of machinery
has followed the introduction of organized co-operation,
so, doubtlessly, a similar process will
follow the gradual adoption of organized co-operation
within the home. This is not the solution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>of the servant problem merely. It has a far wider
significance. Many educated women who are now
seeking useful work and economic independence
outside of home-life will find these within the
domestic circle, and further will find that it is
possible to combine such necessary conditions of
dignified life with fulfilment of duty alike to the
aged and to the young.</p>

<p class='c004'>Pioneers who aim at social solidarity must in
practice recognize labour as the indispensable basis
of social life and social institutions. All methods
of wage-payment dependent on industrial competition
will be repudiated for a system that acknowledges
every form of useful work as entitling the
worker to financial independence; and in the emotional
sphere, with its possibilities of inner union and
solidarity, who can measure the impetus towards
the desired goal that will be given by the setting of
the solitary in families and the re-gathering of the
old into the bosom of a rich, full, domestic life.</p>

<p class='c004'>Let us suppose that from fifteen to twenty groups—they
may be families or groups of friends—combine
and pass out from their numerous separate
houses into one large commodious dwelling built
for them or bought and adapted to their purpose.
The bedrooms are furnished on the continental plan
with accommodation for writing, reading, solitary
study, or rest by day, and all the latest improvements
in lighting, heating and ventilating, etc. By the
rules of the house—except for cleaning—no one
enters these rooms uninvited by the inmate, who has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>there at all times, if wished, perfect privacy and the
most thorough personal comfort. Two eating
apartments are placed contiguous to the kitchens,
and by taking advantage of every invention to
facilitate cooking and serving, the lady-cooks and
attendants may place prepared food on the table
and sit down to partake of it with their friends. One
wing of the house is set apart for nurseries and
nursery training, another for school teaching, inclusive
of indoor kindergarten; a music-room well-deafened
enables the musical to practise many
instruments without jarring the nerves of others;
a playroom for the young and a recreation-room set
apart for whist and chess, etc., a billiard room, and
if desired, a smoking room; a large drawing-room
where social enjoyment is carefully promoted every
evening, a library or silent room where no interruption
to reading is permitted, these, and a few
small boudoirs for intercourse with special friends
form the chief outer requirements of the ideal
collectivist home.</p>

<p class='c004'>All the details of household management may
safely be left to pioneers of the new woman movement;
it belongs only to scientific meliorism to
point out the general features and structure of the
reformed domestic system and to show its vitally
important position in relation to any rational
scheme of wide-reaching social reform.</p>

<p class='c004'>Humanity as a whole has to climb upward in the
scale of being and to leave behind it the individual
or family selfishness allied with animal passions that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>are purely anti-social; it has further to develop that
self-respect that allied with heart-fellowship brings
in its train all the social virtues that distinguish the
man from the brute. Germs of that self-respecting
life are with us even now, but the soil in which they
will spring up to vigorous growth must be created,
i.e. brought together by man himself. The fitting
of character to a new domestic system should not be
difficult in the case of children under wise training,
for it is as easy to acquire good habits in childhood as
bad habits, and the wholesome atmosphere of a
well-regulated superior home will powerfully and
painlessly aid in shaping the young. But for the
grown-up to alter personal habits, and adapt thought
and feeling to a new order of every-day life, the
task is not easy. It may press heavily on the
ordinary adult at the initial stage of the movement.
Happily that task may be rendered easier by
mutual criticism kindly and gravely exercised. The
method was practised for upwards of thirty years in
the Oneida Creek Community with a marked success.
Criticism, says one of the members, is a boon to those
who seek to live a higher life and only a bugbear to
those who lack ambition to improve. It was to the
community a bond of love and an appeal to all that
is noblest, most refined and elevated in human
nature; it helped a man out of his selfishness in the
easiest, most kindly way possible. Whereas in
ordinary life the interference of the busybody, the
tongue of the tale-bearer, the shaft of ridicule, the
venom of malice, are unavoidable—in the Community
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>such criticizing was almost unknown. It
was bad form for anybody to speak complainingly
of anyone else, because criticism was the prerogative
of the Community, and was instituted to supersede
all evil-speaking or back-biting. Nor was it an
occasion for direct fault-finding merely. Those
criticizing were always glad to dilate on the good
qualities of their subject, and to express their love
and appreciation of what they saw to commend.
(Abel Easton, Member of the Oneida Community.)</p>

<p class='c004'>Another member, Allan Estlake, thus speaks:
“Criticism was a barrier to the approach of unworthy
people from without, and equally a bar to
the development of evil influences within.” The
practice was not original. Mr. Noyes found it
established in a select society of missionaries he had
joined previous to his forming the Oneida Community.</p>

<p class='c004'>One of the weekly exercises of this society, he
tells us, was a frank criticism of each other’s
character for the purpose of improvement. The
mode of proceeding was this: At each meeting the
member whose turn it was, according to alphabetic
order, to submit to criticism, held his peace while
the others one by one told him his faults. This
exercise sometimes crucified self-complacency, but
it was contrary to the rules of society for any one to
complain. I found much benefit in submitting to
this ordeal both while I was at Andover and afterward.<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c015'><sup>[12]</sup></a>
If a number of young men adopted criticism
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>as a means of improvement it should not be more
difficult to pioneers of the new domestic life, young
and old, provided they have the same desire to
improve. It might be irksome to the young, until
they had learned to profit by it, as all discipline is at
first, but when “our young people,” says Mr. Estlake,
“had formed habits in harmony with their means
of improvement they learned to love the means by
which they had progressed and to rejoice in the
results of sufferings that were incident only to their
inexperience.”<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c015'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004'>Personal habits in the new domestic life will be
judged in their relation to the general interests of
the household, and regulations made to safeguard
these interests. Cleanliness, orderliness, punctuality
are essential to home comfort, but conventional
etiquette destroys the geniality of domestic freedom.
While simple rules of a positive kind are strictly
observed, the negative rule of non-interference with
personal habits that are unhurtful to others will be
the most stringent of all, and for this reason—happiness
is the great object to attain, and a supreme
condition of happiness is the free interaction of
social units without intrusive interference.</p>

<p class='c004'>Committees will be necessary—for organizing labour
on a method that will ensure variety to workers
and frequent leisure—for consultation on the best
means to adopt in training children individually—for
management of the finances—for recreative
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>arrangements—and for purposes of general direction
and control.</p>

<p class='c004'>Authority will of course devolve on these committees
chosen by members of the household from
among themselves. Every relic of primitive despotism
must be banished from the home: it is a self-acting
republic. Since children reared in the home
will be one day responsible citizens of a republican
state, it were well to enlist them early in the work
of committees. They will learn thereby to subordinate
personal desire to the will of the majority,
and to co-operate in action for the common weal.
The amusements and conduct of children are well
within range of their own understanding, and
although supervision by adults is necessary, great
freedom should be allowed them in the management
of their conduct clubs and amusement committees.</p>

<p class='c004'>The relinquishment of personal property is not
desirable at the present stage of social evolution;
for individuals—and there may be some—who,
however willing, are unable to adapt themselves
to the new system, should possess the power to
return to the old system without let or hindrance.</p>

<p class='c004'>Nevertheless, be it sooner or later, the ideal
collectivist home of the future will realize, though
at first imperfectly, the beautiful conception held
by Isaac Taylor of the ideal family home of the
past. Here is the picture: “Home is a garden, high-walled
towards the blighting northeast of selfish
care. In the home we possess a main means of
raising the happiest feelings to a high pitch and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>keeping them there. No disparagement, no privation
is to be endured by some for the aggrandizement
or ease of others. Along with great inequalities
of dignity, power and merit, there is yet a
perfect and unconscious equality in regard to
comforts, enjoyments and personal consideration.
There is no room for grudges or individual solicitude.
Whatever may be the measure of good for the whole
the sum is distributed without a thought of distinction
between one and another. Refined and
generous emotions may thus have room to expand,
and may become the fixed habits of the mind.
Within the circle of home each is known to all, and
all respect the same principles of justice and love.
There is therefore no need for that caution, reserve
or suspicion that in the open world are safeguards
against the guile, lawlessness and ferocity of a
few.”<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c015'><sup>[14]</sup></a> There, too, may be wholly discarded that
reticence with which, as with a cloak, the modern,
civilized man, says Lucas Mallet, strives to hide
the noblest and purest of his thought.</p>

<p class='c004'>The new system fully worked out will make
homes permanent instead of transitory. It will
check the premature sending of girls out into the
world and the tendency of young life generally to
drift. It will develop industrial activities and give
effective household labour. It will lessen the sordid
cares of humanity and increase its social joys. It
will create an environment calculated to restrain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>tempestuous youth and cause every selfish passion
to subside in the presence of mutual love. It will
perfect education by co-ordinating the life of the
young and securing that the entire juvenile orbit is
governed by forces of fixed congruity. It will
provide every comfort for old age and garner its
dearly-bought experience. It will promote healthy
propagation causing the birth of the fit; it will
facilitate marriage of the affections and make early
marriage possible. It will tend infancy in a wholly
superior manner, and by scientific breeding, rearing,
training, produce future citizens of the State of a
higher intellectual, moral and spiritual type.</p>

</div>

<h4 class='c019'><span class='sc'>Section 1</span></h4>

<p class='c014'>Is this material universe self-sufficient and self-contained,
or is not the “other conception,” the true one, viz. “that
of a universe lying open to all manner of spiritual influences,
permeated through and through with a divine spirit,
guided and watched by living minds acting through the
medium of law indeed, but with intelligence and love behind
the law; a universe by no means self-sufficient or self-contained,
but with feelers at every pore groping into another
supersensuous order of existence where reigns laws hitherto
unimagined by science, but laws as real and as mighty as
those by which the material universe is governed?”—<span class='sc'>Sir
Oliver Lodge</span>, “The Outstanding Controversy between
Science and Faith,” <cite>Hibbert Journal</cite> for October, 1902.</p>

<p class='c008'>To the man of Western civilization, whose
environment in youth was a domestic atmosphere
of Sabbath-day Christian orthodoxy and week-day
religious indifference along with a social atmosphere
of commercial individualism and the steady pursuit
of sense pleasures, it is no easy task to form a
correct judgment regarding the true position of
religion and its relative worth in evolution.</p>

<p class='c004'>A study of the subject reveals that not only the
more and less civilized races of mankind have each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>some specialized form of religion, but the non-civilized
savage tribes of the earth are similarly
endowed. Their worship may be degraded to the
last degree, but it holds them in its grasp, and in
studying these facts we are compelled to believe
that humanity is so constituted that its deepest
needs are only to be expressed through and by
religion.</p>

<p class='c004'>The various religions of the world must have
been essential to evolution, since evolution, as
applied to man, signifies the ample, thorough
development of every integral part of human nature
in each individual. But while recognizing religion
as a necessary expression of human nature and a
supreme characteristic of man, we have also to
realize that its forms are as various as the distinctive
differences amongst men, and that changes
from time to time inevitably occur for good or evil
in every religion. None are stationary, none are
perfect. And the spiritual verities which lie at the
base of all are constantly overlaid by superstitions,
while the external forms harden and grow inoperative
for good.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now, on the theory that religion is in effect necessary
to evolution, and further, that it represents
fundamentally an emanation from the plane of
spirit, i.e. from a region transcending our phenomenal
existence, what would nineteenth century
intelligence <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</span></i> expect of the various divergent
religious systems? That amid variations, some
striking similarities would exist to indicate the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>identity of their original source. It would expect
also to find some statement of facts in nature not
otherwise known to man, some recognition of the
stupendous movement of evolution—the elucidation
of which in its physical aspect is the grand achievement
of modern science—and some hint of the laws
governing that movement. Further, it would
expect to find guidance to right conduct and some
indications of the paramount purpose and end of
universal life.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hitherto, as it happens, the investigating spirit
of modern science has concerned itself little with
theological matters; and the recognized exponents
of our own racial theology are incompetent judges
here. Their training has made of them religious
specialists so interpenetrated by sectarian dogma
that they are incapable of assuming the mental
attitude of a genuine criticism claiming no superiority
for Christianity over other great religions, save
such value of position as lies in its later birth and
development. Outside the churches, however,
comparative theology is not neglected, and it is
freely admitted now by many earnest students of
the subject that all the great religions of the world
possess spiritual, ethical and philosophical ideas in
common.</p>

<p class='c004'>Hinduism deals with startling facts of the invisible
world. In the Vedas<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c015'><sup>[15]</sup></a> it teaches that consciousness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>is the foundation or groundwork of all nature,
that matter and force are instinct with conscious
life. Behind these is the great unmanifested
Deity—the “Unknowable” of our own Spencerian
philosophy—the Illimitable, Eternal, Absolute,
Unconditioned Source of the Universe, incognizable
and inconceivable to the finite faculties of man.
With manifestation there appears the threefold
aspect of Deity—the supreme Logos of the Universe—a
Unity in Trinity and a Trinity in Unity, the
reflection of which as Consciousness, Substance,
Force, runs throughout nature, and is also shown
in the Christian and other creeds and the Pauline
description of man’s triune constitution—body,
soul and spirit. The doctrine of evolution is
taught in Hinduism on far wider lines than the
modern intellectual conception lays down. The
latter, dealing with outward appearance, bases
itself on physical phenomena. The former transcends
phenomenal existence and human experience.
It embraces the superlatively great, the infinitely
small and complex, and presents a cosmogony
evolutional throughout, while it points to a spiritual
development for the individual so extensive and
sublime that the Western mind, unused to metaphysical
thought, is unable to grasp and clothe it in
words. In this philosophy there is no stultifying
of human endeavour by the view of the soul’s
opportunities as confined to three score years and
ten. That span of life makes but a single page in
the soul’s vast evolutional history, for at the centre
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>of Hinduism lies a rock-bed of belief in re-incarnation—that
process of nature which accomplishes
the gradual growth and spiritual elevation of
humanity by means of the individual soul’s successive
returns to physical life, with intervening periods
of spiritual rest or latency. The threefold nature
of man gives him touch with three levels of existence,
and Hindu religion represents him bound to a wheel
unceasingly turning in three worlds, viz. a world of
waking consciousness or the physical body, and of
two other worlds to which he passes successively
at and after death, and in which he works out his
latest earthly experience and assimilates all its
fruit, then returns through the gateway of
birth to begin a fresh course of discipline and
learning.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f15'>
<p class='c004'><a href='#r15'>15</a>. It is from the study of the Vedas that the educated
Hindu seeks to derive his creed. I refer my reader to
Mr. J. E. Slater’s <cite>Higher Hinduism in relation to Christianity</cite>.</p>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Turning from the transcendental to the scientific
and practical sides of Hinduism, we find an external
worship and broad polity calculated to regulate
human conduct in every relation of life, religious,
national, social, family and personal—the entire
system founded on the law of causation on all
planes of being. By our own scientists, that law is
recognized on the physical plane as the invariable
sequence of cause and effect. Hinduism regards
it as working also on higher planes, and terms it the
law of action or Karma—the moral retribution
which brings out inexorably in one life the results
following from causes arising in previous lives.
Responsibility therefore rests with every self-conscious,
reflective being, and divine justice is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>shown reconcilable with the free-will of man through
the union of Karma and re-incarnation. “God is
not mocked; whatsoever a man soweth that shall
he also reap.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The religion of the Parsis, i.e. the modern form
of Zoroastrianism, has equally with Hinduism a
metaphysical philosophy, and an outward worship,
while mingled with all there is an astronomical
teaching based on the same conception of nature as
is found in Hinduism, viz. that it is the manifestation,
in infinitely varied forms, of the one universal
consciousness or mind. The constitution of humanity
is two-fold. Spirit and matter are two distinct
and different principles, both are in man; and he is
capable of siding definitely with either. The ethic
of Zoroastrian faith is based on the belief that he will
throw himself on the side of the pure, that he will
battle for it and maintain it. To be at all times
actively on the side of purity is a clear personal duty.
The devout Zoroastrian must keep the earth pure
and till it religiously. He must perform the
functions of agriculture as a service to the gods, for
the earth is the pure creature of Ahura Mazdao—the
Supreme Spirit to be guarded from all pollution.
And passing from the outer to the inner life of the
individual, the constantly-repeated maxim is this:
I withdraw from all sins by pure thoughts, pure
deeds, pure words.</p>

<p class='c004'>In Taoism, a religion of China of earlier date than
Hinduism or Zoroastrianism, there exists a fragment
of ancient scripture called the Classic of Purity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>wherein man is regarded as a trinity, viz. spirit,
mind, body. To quote from Mr. Legge’s translation:
“Now the spirit of man loves purity, but his
mind disturbs it. The mind of man loves stillness,
but his desires draw it away. If he could always
send his desires away, his mind would of itself become
still. Let his mind be made clean, and his spirit
will of itself become pure.” (Here we have the idea,
expressed in all religions, of the conflict between the
higher and lower nature in man and the necessity
for spirit to dominate mind and body. Refer to
St. Paul’s Epistle to the Romans, vii. 15, 21, 22
and 23.)</p>

<p class='c004'>Again, Buddhism has absorbed the attention of
modern Oriental scholars through the fascination
of the Buddha’s purity and elevation of thought.
There are two divisions of this faith, viz., the
Mahayana, that of the Northern Church, found in
Tibet, Nepaul, China, Corea, and Japan, and the
Hinayana, that of the Southern Church, found in
Ceylon, Burmah, Siam, etc. The Mahayana
(Greater Vehicle) is closely allied to Hinduism in its
teachings regarding the spiritual world, the continuing
ego of individual man, the life after death,
the rites and ceremonies of worship, and the mystic
side of personal religion. In the Hinayana (Lesser
Vehicle) of the Southern Church, much of this
mystic teaching has been dropped, nevertheless it
retains a wonderful system of ethics, with appeals
made to human reason, and a constant attempt to
justify and render intelligible the foundations on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>which the morals are built. Buddhism is clearly
the daughter of the more ancient Hinduism. Its
scriptures are the echo of the Hindu scriptures, and
the general teachings, while thrown into a less
metaphysical form, are penetrated with the Hindu
spirit. Causation is in both an unbroken law. In
the Dhammapada, for instance, it is written: “If
a man speaks or acts with a pure thought, happiness
follows him like a shadow that never leaves him.
If a man speaks or acts with an evil thought, pain
follows him as the wheel follows the foot of the ox
that draws the carriage. He who has done what is
evil cannot free himself of it, he may have done it
long ago or afar off, he may have done it in solitude,
but he cannot cast it off.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Buddha taught that evil is overcome only by its
opposite, i.e. good: “Let every man overcome
anger by love, let him overcome the greedy by
liberality, the liar by truth,” etc., etc. And here
the religion is closely in touch with Christian ethics:
“Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do
good to them that hate you,” etc. “Love is the
fulfilling of the Law.” With regard to man’s
destiny, Buddha’s teachings build on his hearers’
acceptance of the Hindu doctrine of re-incarnation.</p>

<p class='c004'>(In the Pali Canon occur these words: “The
Bhikshee [the disciple] sees, with eye divine, beings
dropping away and reappearing, he knows them
reaping according to their several karma, degraded
and ennobled, beautiful and ugly, well-placed and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>ill-placed.” From this and many other passages of
the Pali Canon “it is clear and evident and beyond
a shadow of doubt,” says J. C. Chatterji, “that the
Buddha taught the identity of the re-incarnating
ego, though he did not give it that name. He
called it Consciousness or Vignana.”—<cite>Theosophical
Review</cite>, Jan., 1898, p. 415.) Without that his
system falls to the ground. The path of salvation
he points to implies a persistent course of personal
effort, and he who would tread that path must open
his mind to discriminate between things that are
transitory and those that are real and permanent.
To the former belong all the pleasures of sense, every
earthly desire and ambition, and every selfish
thought.</p>

<p class='c004'>Deep within man’s nature, however, there lies hid
a germ or seed of the permanent. This will persist
throughout all the ages amid the fleeting phantasmagoria
of many lives, and this he must cherish,
nourish, develop. He must resist and renounce the
corrupting influences of the flesh. He must master
his passions, steady his mind, and control, enlighten
and elevate his thoughts. Further, he must purify
his emotions and actions, pervading the world with
a “heart of love, far-reaching, grown great and
beyond measure.” (The Tevijja Sutta.) Finally,
the individual consciousness will expand, until, able
to function in subtler vehicles than those of physical
matter, the man passes out of the chrysalis state
of formal existence to emerge upon higher levels of
life and reach at length the Buddhist Nirvana—that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>supreme crown of immortality and acme of conscious
bliss.</p>

<p class='c004'>This pilgrimage of the soul through many births
and deaths, with its steadfast struggles and gradual
liberation from all earthly debasing entanglements,
forms a striking contrast to certain teachings of the
modern Christian Churches. Dogma there presents
to us an undeveloped helpless soul, as playing—within
a circumscribed area of earth’s surface—its
one little game of experimental life. The fate
of the soul for all eternity hangs in the balance, all
its chances for weal or woe depending on a single
throw of the dice. And what are the terms of the
game? Conditions of life so adverse, in millions of
cases, that defeat is a foregone conclusion. No
wonder civilized men with a seedling of justice in
the soul, reject the whole scheme of nature allied
with this dogma, and frankly disavow religious
faith.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the question arises, how does it happen that
Christianity, with an ethic fundamentally the same
as that of every other great religion of the world,
diverges so completely here? Is it conceivable that
Christianity, while of Divine origin, has become in
process of time dwarfed and deformed to the extent
even of losing some <em>essential</em> features? It holds, as
sectarian pulpits represent it, no doctrine of re-incarnation,
and appears to have no clear basis of
metaphysical or philosophic thought. Moreover,
it has elements impossible to reconcile with the
mental and emotional developments of a scientific
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>and intellectual age. The anthropomorphic conception
of Deity, the almost literal interpretation of
the Jewish allegory of creation, the personalization
of the metaphysical and mystic Trinity; the
approval of the barbarous sacrifices and vengeful
Deity of the Old Testament; the anti-evolutional
doctrine of the vicarious Atonement in the New
Testament; the crude ideas concerning the soul,
heaven and hell; and the absence of any evolutional
theory applied to human destiny—all these, and
above all the ignorance and pride that claim for
this particular form of religion a unique position in
the world’s history, and assume that it alone and no
other religion is the revelation of God to man, show
an ample justification for the fact that the most
intelligent men and women of Western civilization
stand outside the Christian Churches to-day, or are
in them from motives that have nothing to do with
devout religious feeling.</p>

<p class='c004'>If, however, we turn to the history of the Church
and search its ancient records, or if unable ourselves
to grapple with the problem, we place confidence in
the evidence of students who have done so, we find
that an entirely new light is thrown on Christianity
and its real position. In the writings of the Christian
Fathers, there is a constant reference made
to grades of members and teaching within the early
Church. First, the general members, and from
those the pure in life went into a second grade. The
latter formed the “few chosen” from the many
called. But beyond these were the “chosen of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>chosen,” who, “with perfect knowledge lived in
perfection of righteousness according to the law.”
Clement of Alexandria, one of the greatest of the
Fathers of the Church, wrote: “It is not to be
wished that all things should be exposed indiscriminately
to all and sundry, or the benefits of wisdom
communicated to those who have not, even in a
dream, been purified in soul&#160;... nor are the
mysteries of the word to be expounded to the
profane.” Origen tells us that Jesus conversed with
His disciples in private, and especially in their most
secret retreats, concerning the Gospel of God; but
the words He uttered have not been preserved. And
when Celsus assailed Christianity as a secret system,
Origen replied such a notion was absurd, “but that
there should be certain doctrines not made known
to the multitude and which are revealed after the
exoteric doctrines have been taught, is not a peculiarity
of Christianity alone, but also of philosophic
systems, in which certain truths are exoteric and
others esoteric.” Elsewhere he explains that
Scripture is threefold in meaning, that it is the
“flesh” for simple men, the “soul” for the more
instructed, the “spirit” for the “perfect,” and in
corroboration he quotes from Scripture the words of
St. Paul, “We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery,
even the hidden wisdom,” and “we speak wisdom
amongst them that are perfect.”</p>

<p class='c004'>We have here, then, more than a trace of some
deeper teaching than appears on the surface of
Christianity, some mine of hidden truth too sacred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>and profound for open display to the undiscerning
multitude. Is it not evident that Christianity
contains at its centre, known only to the few, the
same transcendental and spiritual conceptions, the
same supra-physical and mystical philosophy as the
ancient religions contain? But if this be so, how
came the most precious truths of religion to be
apparently lost?</p>

<p class='c004'>They were lost through the uncomprehending
ignorance of the early followers of the Master, Christ,
and the sectarian bigotry of ecclesiastics who cut
themselves apart from the holders of the inner
teaching and, becoming a majority, overcame the
learned few, stamping as heretics the last remnants
known as Christian Gnostics, Manicheans, Pelasgians,
and Arians, all of whom, counted schismatics,
were eventually crushed out through cruel persecution
by the victorious orthodox Latin and Greek
Churches. Nevertheless, some fragments of the
hidden wisdom of the early teaching have survived
in the uncomprehended symbols of the creeds and
ceremonies of the Churches. (I refer my reader to
Mr. C. W. Leadbeater’s work, <cite>The Christian Creed</cite>.)</p>

<p class='c004'>That re-incarnation and Karma formed part of
the original teaching is, I think, abundantly evident.
In Gnosticism and Manicheism they were apparent.
The Christian Fathers speak plainly of these doctrines,
and Origen refers to Pythagoras, Plato and
Empedocles as holding them. Moreover, Jesus
Christ is made to utter a clear statement concerning
John the Baptist, that implies the doctrine of re-incarnation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>and his answer to the question about a
blind man, “who did sin, this man or his parents,
that he was born blind?” shows the acceptance in
the early Church of both doctrines. The whole
incident reveals that the subject of re-incarnation
was familiar to the followers of Christ, and Josephus
expressly states that the Pharisees held the doctrine
of re-birth. There is then little doubt that in the
<em>early</em> Church the belief was widely spread, but later
at a General Council—a Council held after darkness
had begun its reign—it was formally condemned
and stamped as a heresy.</p>

<p class='c004'>Bearing in mind the view that all the great
religions come from the same spiritual source, it is
significant to find the following in the writings of a
rigid Roman Catholic historian, viz. A. F. Ozanam:
“Having burst over the borders of the country to
which it had once been confined, Buddhism at the
year 61 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> made a new appearance on the scene,
and invaded all Northern Asia.... This great
movement could not but influence the West. It
effected its entrance (into Christendom) through
the Gnostic sects. The Gnosis was the designation
of a higher science or initiation reserved for a handful
of chosen spirits.” Again, speaking of the Manicheans,
he says: “It is difficult to decide whether
Manes drew his system originally from these
Buddhist sources or found the teaching which he
handed down to his disciples held by former Gnostic
sects, themselves impregnated with the Oriental
doctrine.” (Ozanam’s <cite>History of Civilization in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>the Fifth Century</cite>, vol. i. pp. 247 and 254.) It is easy
to see that this Oriental doctrine was none other
than the hidden wisdom of Jesus and Paul as
well as of Buddha.</p>

<p class='c004'>The special doctrine of re-incarnation is said to
be absent in the fragments of the Avesta and in the
Zend commentaries, and absent also in the latter
Pahlavi doctrines. It is not held by the modern
Parsis. “On the other hand,” says G. R. S. Mead,
B.A., M.R.A.S., “Greek writers emphatically assert
that the doctrine of re-incarnation was one of the
main tenets of the Magian tradition.” The same
author elsewhere remarks: “Since Bardaisan, like
all the great Gnostics, believed in re-incarnation,
such a conception as the resurrection of the physical
body was nothing but a gross superstition of the
ignorant.” (The <cite>Theosophical Review</cite> for March,
1898, p. 17.)</p>

<p class='c004'>To judge Christianity fairly, it was necessary to
know something of its origin, its antecedents and the
early phases of its life. We had to follow the history
of its early sects and observe the changes effected
in the Church by forces playing upon it from without.
The Church gradually rose into a position of social
influence and authority, from which it again declined,
and it was during the latter condition that in its
struggles to maintain power and supremacy amid
adverse forces it dropped out the mystic beliefs
difficult of apprehension by Western minds; it
ceased to order and classify its adherents, and it
ultimately adapted its doctrines to the materialistic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>spirit of the dawning era of modern science.<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c015'><sup>[16]</sup></a>
Nevertheless, the Church retained its pure <em>ethical</em>
teaching. It has held up to view the noble unselfish
life of its founder Jesus of Nazareth. No one could
deny that during the period even of its degradation,
this religion has proved to millions of human beings
a source of vital comfort and joy, and to some extent
of spiritual light.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f16'>
<p class='c004'><a href='#r16'>16</a>. Tertullian complains: “They have all access alike;
they hear alike, they pray alike, even heathens if any such
happen to come among them.”</p>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The tendency of Protestantism was to assert the
claims of all men—the weak and childish as well as
the thoughtful and intellectually strong—to a clear
understanding of the Church’s whole teaching. In
pursuance of a policy to meet this demand, the
Church gave forth a simplified presentation of God
and Nature that contradicts the plainest facts of
science, and creates within minds of deeper, more
expanded faculty, a conscientious revolt from the
Christian faith to an attitude of honest scepticism.
Outside the Church, however, other forces of evolution
have prevailed to carry man forward, and to-day
there exists an earnest and devout spirit of inquiry,
and a strong dissatisfaction with the purely materialistic
theory of Nature.</p>

<p class='c004'>Conspicuous among the forces of change are, first,
the study of physical phenomena on scientific
methods, a study which, by convincing the Western
mind of a profound mystery behind all phenomena,
gives fresh impulse to speculative thought, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>rouses effort to reach and apprehend the law of
evolution. Second, the study of psychic phenomena
revealing modes of consciousness hitherto ignored,
and impelling science to penetrate the hidden
recesses of our psychic activities and investigate
some of the heights and depths of man’s inner constitution.
Third, the historical studies that throw
new light on the marvellous civilizations of the past
and those religions that are more ancient than
Christianity.</p>

<p class='c004'>Whatever the ultimate outcome of these studies
may prove, it is clear that the perspective of early
faiths—their range and reach—was vaster than
that of current Christianity, and this perception is
creeping into our popular literature and laying hold
of public thought. For instance, a recent writer
remarks: “The modern scientific revelation of
stellar evolution and dissolution seems a prodigious
confirmation of Buddhist theories of cosmical law.”
And again, “With the acceptance of the doctrine
of evolution old forms of thought crumbled, new
ideas arose to take the place of worn-out dogmas,
and we have a general intellectual movement in
directions strangely parallel with Oriental philosophy.”
(Lafcadio Hearn’s <cite>Hints and Echoes of
Japanese Inner Life</cite>.)</p>

<p class='c004'>This movement necessarily will advance only by
carrying with it, i.e. convincing step by step, the
reason of man, and seeing that Oriental philosophy
has the doctrines of re-incarnation and Karma at its
foundation, these must be tested and the fact ascertained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>whether or not they are consistent with the
laws of phenomenal existence already discovered
and believed in by the Occidental mind. “To-day,”
says Lafcadio Hearn, “for the student of scientific
psychology, the idea of pre-existence passes out of
the realm of theory into the realm of fact,” and
he quotes in corroboration of this statement Professor
Huxley’s opinion of the theory—“None but
very hasty thinkers will reject it on the ground of
inherent absurdity. Like the doctrine of evolution
itself, that of transmigration has its roots in the
world of reality, and it may claim such support as
the great argument from analogy is capable of
supplying.” (<cite>Evolution and Ethics</cite>, p. 61, Ed.
1894.)</p>

<p class='c004'>At this epoch of the world’s history, the humanity
that exists is of an infinitely varied character. At
one end of the scale, we have in savages the simplest
forms of racial types, at the other the most complex
forms, and between these every conceivable variant.
The distinctions go deeper as we ascend the scale,
and there are no two beings alike in their powers of
abstract thinking, the nature of their intellectual,
emotional and moral qualities, and the groupings
of these qualities—in a word, their individualities.
Now one thing demanded by the developed intellects
of this age is a generalization that will cover and
explain these perplexing differences. The law of
heredity does this to a very limited extent only. So
far as the physical structure is concerned it explains
much; but when we come to the mental and moral
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>developments, its insufficiency is apparent. Genius
and idiocy may be found springing up from the same
parent stock and under identical conditions of training
in childhood. Variety of character will appear
in children of the same family from almost the
moment of birth. One infant comes into the world
handicapped by a sullen temper and vicious disposition,
another with the most lovable traits. It is
inconceivable that these incongruous effects flow
from congruous causes on the physical plane. And
were we able to logically accept these physical causes
as adequate, no civilized being could morally respect
the ordering of a universe wherein innocent souls
newly created enter life handicapped by vicious
propensities. Either the Power behind all phenomena
is a malevolent Power, or the universe is a
chaos—the inconsequent outcome of random chance.</p>

<p class='c004'>These painful alternatives cease their troubling,
however, and all perplexities gradually disappear as
the mind of man grows into a clear apprehension of
evolution in its full significance. The basic law of
evolution is that all existence proceeds in cycles,
each having its objective and subjective arc. In
other words, there is a constant flow of motion and
consciousness from without within and from within
without. On the lowlier levels of life, this law is
observed and science based upon it. In the
vegetable kingdom, the leaves, stalk and flower of a
specific plant perish as completely as though they
had never existed; but the subjective entity
remains, and in due course it reappears, clothed in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>a different vestment of cells, the same in all the
details of its intricate form.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the insect kingdom, all the wonderful changes
that transform a crawling slimy caterpillar into a
glorious vision of beauty and grace takes place in
silence and darkness—from within without. Here
the law of evolution takes a wider range than in the
vegetable kingdom. Form, function, habit, all are
changed, yet we know by actual observation that
the soaring butterfly and crawling caterpillar are
intrinsically one and the same. Moreover, the
whole process of change is accomplished in the pupa
stage independently of that food supply which—to
the scientific conception—seems indispensable in
the generation and continuation of vital force. (I
must here refer my reader to the full discussion of
this subject in chapters v. and vi. of Dr. Jerome
A. Anderson’s <cite>Re-incarnation—A Study of the Human
Soul</cite>.)</p>

<p class='c004'>Now in our habit of regarding humanity in its
higher aspect as the acme or crown of terrestrial life,
we are apt to forget the potent connexions that link
it with life in general. But re-incarnation, if we
would judge it philosophically, must not be wrenched
from its place in the order of nature and studied as
an isolated fragment.</p>

<p class='c004'>“All evolution consists,” says Mrs. Besant, “of
an evolving life passing from form to form as it
evolves, and storing up the experience gained
through the forms; the re-incarnation of the human
soul is not the introduction of a new principle into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>evolution, but the adaptation of the universal
principle to meet conditions rendered necessary by
the individualization of the continually evolving
life.” (<cite>The Ancient Wisdom</cite>, p. 234.) The doctrine
of human evolution summed up in the term re-incarnation
cannot be proved in the same sense as a
new discovery in physics can be proved—that goes
without saying. But we may claim that it can be
so nearly proved by reasoning that no intelligent
being who correctly apprehends the idea and applies
it with patience to the experience of existence,
whether in or out of the body, can fail to believe it
as fully, for example, as the modern scientific world
believes in the electro-magnetic theory of light.
That theory is no longer argued about. It is the
only theory that will explain all the facts. And of
re-incarnation in a higher domain we may equally
affirm it is the only theory that explains the facts
and is consonant with all the known laws of nature.
It is luminous with a truly scientific aspect. It
satisfactorily accounts for the inherent differences
in character that heredity leaves unexplained, and
it renews our faith in love and wisdom as underlying
the phenomena of earthly existence, notwithstanding
present appearances.</p>

<p class='c004'>But add to this the fact that every great religion
of the world, except modern Christianity, holds it
more or less completely, whilst Christianity also
originally held it; and if a spiritual and ethical
theory of the universe be tenable, then cultured
minds rejecting re-incarnation must either have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>failed to study the subject in its antecedents and
bearings, or they must be by constitution profoundly
unphilosophical. (I refer my reader here to
chap. iii. of Mr. A. P. Sinnett’s <cite>Growth of the
Soul</cite>.)</p>

<p class='c004'>After all, it is a comparatively few men and women
who seek intellectual clearness of vision, and are
restless of soul till they grasp a theory of the universe
and an interpretation of life that alike may
satisfy head and heart—the mass of mankind is
unthinking. And as we contemplate the stupendous
task of evolution in developing each individual soul
out of the embryonic condition of the savage to a
conscious control and exercise of all the divine
potencies of a perfected spiritual man, we feel no
surprise that the major part of humanity stands yet
in its childhood. Unequal development is the
natural corollary of general evolution. The heart
of modern man, however, is for the most part in
advance of his head, and it is here, viz. on the
emotional side of human nature, that religion—no
matter what the specific form may have been—has
ministered to man’s needs and proved an all-important
factor of evolution.</p>

<p class='c004'>Revelation, as Lessing (who believed in re-incarnation)
declares, has been the education of the
human race. “It did not,” he says, “give anything
that human reason left to itself would not arrive at,
but it gave the most important of these things
earlier”—that is, before the reasoning faculties were
fully developed in man. (Lessing’s Treatise: <cite>The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>Education of the Human Race</cite>, translated by the
Rev. F. W. Robertson.)</p>

<p class='c004'>The founders of every religion—the great and
wise ones of the earth—have guided the race in its
slow and gradual ascent from infancy to manhood,
and even through the degeneration to which every
religion has been subjected from human ignorance
and selfishness.</p>

<h4 class='c019'><span class='sc'>Section 2</span></h4>

<p class='c020'>We have now to turn from racial religions to
personal religion, and as the springs of individual
conduct lie earlier in the heart than in the head,
spiritual developments begin there. It is in accordance
with natural order that the right conduct and
simple devotion of millions of human beings,
intellectually blind, should yet aid the steady
advance of evolution towards its highest goal.</p>

<p class='c004'>The pilgrim soul pressing forward through a long
series of births and deaths has a chequered career of
conquest and defeat, until, experience guiding effort
and overcoming waywardness, the animal stage of
existence has been distanced and left behind. But
each of these pilgrim souls pursues a path specifically
its own, that is, differing from that of every other
pilgrim soul. The paths pursued are divided by
Eastern thought into three distinct classes. First,
that of action; second, that of devotion; third, that
of wisdom. In the first class are to be found men
and women of infinitely varied powers taking part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>in all the activities of the world, and striving with
keenness to attain certain desired results. Commencing,
it may be, with low, selfish, narrow motives
of action, these gradually alter and improve, till
motive and action alike have become pure, unselfish
and directed to the widest beneficence. Such types
of humanity tread the first path, that of action, and
in it are harvesting precious experience. They are
developing interiorly the powers that make for
righteousness.</p>

<p class='c004'>To the second class belong all the world’s sincere
religionists, those beings whose regard—whether
of fear or love—goes out to an ideal person. The
person, observe, may be of low or of high grade in
accordance with the subjective development of the
individual worshipper. As the object of devotion
becomes purified, love casts out fear, and advance
on this path proceeds. Men and women adoring
their conception of Krishna, or Buddha, of Ahura
Mazdao, or of Jesus Christ, are treading the path of
devotion, and may rise to the highest emotions of
altruism, the most selfless service of the Supreme,
thus harmonizing ever more and more the human
will and the Divine will.</p>

<p class='c004'>Pilgrims of the third and smallest class are men
and women whose constant desire and endeavour is
to search out the truth of things. In the earlier
grades of this path will be found scientific investigators
of physical phenomena; more advanced on
the path are materialist philosophers and all
individuals directing their efforts to an examination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>of man in the regions of emotion and mind. Above
these again are the men and women whose search
is into the innermost nature of things, and who, in
the intensity of that search, lose more and more
their feeling of self, and merge themselves in Divine
knowledge.</p>

<p class='c004'>To summarise the three paths: The first is a
progress through human activities from motives of
self to motives of highest altruism. The second is
a progress through religious emotions, from fear of
an invisible demon, to the most selfless love of an
ideal person and unswerving devotion to true ideals.
The third is a progress from the simplest efforts to
discover truth to the acquisition of Divine wisdom
by means of the immensely increased faculties of the
perfected man.</p>

<p class='c004'>These three paths, like different ways up a
mountain, meet at the top, where pilgrims attain to
the qualities of all, and not only of the one path
mainly traversed by each. All attain in the end to
the fullest development of human power and faculty,
and to complete liberation from the chain of births
and deaths. That personal goodness and religious
zeal are the measure of spiritual development is
only the Church’s view, and it ignores a large part
of human efforts and activities. Without personal
goodness certainly no spiritual life is possible, but
beyond the acme of personal goodness to lofty
heights of knowledge, of wisdom, of transcendent
love and benevolence, rises the pilgrim human soul
under Divine tuition.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>We have now to inquire wherein the pilgrims
resemble one another? The feature common to all
is the inner attitude of self-surrender. It may
spring from impulse or a half-unconscious sense of
duty. Or, it may result from the reasoning faculty,
from reason controlling and directing conduct with
a full consciousness of responsibility. Again, it may
be allied with all the sacred aspirations and inspirations
that follow upon a long course of development,
but whatever the cause and degree, this attitude of
mind makes it possible for the spiritual forces
working in and through humanity as a whole to
manifest there, expanding the heart and mind, and
creating a further soul-evolution.</p>

<p class='c004'>There is a law in nature which has been well called
the pulse of our planetary system, a law of giving
out. It involves no absolute and ultimate sacrifice;
and it is the only law by which progress and exaltation
in nature can be actually achieved. Now this
law is a central part of the teaching of every great
religion. The Logos, we are told, in bringing into
existence an infinitude of centres of consciousness,
made the voluntary sacrifice of limiting His own
boundless life. This thought is expressed in the
Christian Scriptures thus: “The Lamb slain from
the foundation of the world.” This first great outbreathing
of the life of the Logos is the earliest
presentation of the law of sacrifice—that law which
prescribes that at every stage of evolution life and
energy shall be given out for the benefit of some
consciousness on a lower grade than the giver. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>great principle of evolution is manifest in the unselfish
benevolence of all good men and women;
even when they are working as yet in blind obedience
to the scarcely articulate impulses of their awakening
spiritual natures. (I refer my reader to p. 452 of
Mr. A. P. Sinnett’s <cite>The Growth of the Soul</cite>.)</p>

<p class='c004'>To our minds pain seems necessarily connected
with sacrifice, but pain proceeds wholly from discord
within the sacrificer, i.e. from antagonism between
the higher part of his nature which is willing to give,
and the lower part whose satisfaction lies in grasping
and keeping. The process required in each case is
a turning from the selfish, individualistic attitude
to that of a social, altruistic giving—a giving joyfully
for love’s sake. The transition naturally
involves some pain, for the conscious will has to
gradually master the animal part of the nature, and
subordinate it to the higher self.</p>

<p class='c004'>Man is, in the order of evolution, primarily subject
to animal desires. His consciousness moves on the
sensuous plane of existence, and he clings to the
physical elements in nature. By-and-bye he learns
to relinquish an immediate material good for a
future good equally material—it may be a greater
worldly prosperity for himself or his family. This
sacrifice is not essentially noble, but it prepares the
way for a harder lesson, and one that calls out a
deeper faculty within him. Here again the process
is one of exchange, but not of one form of sensuous
good for another. It is the exchange of material
possessions or sense pleasures for something of an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>entirely different order in nature—a reward not
visible, nay, possibly far off beyond the tomb.</p>

<p class='c004'>When humanity was in its childhood, religion
inculcated and pressed upon it this form of sacrifice;
and as we ponder the martyr lives that stud the
pages of history we recognize the fact that thousands
of human beings practised the precept, and learned
to endure, as seeing the invisible, to stand morally
upright without earthly prop, to value spiritual
companionship and joy in an inner life of purity and
peace when outward conditions were adverse and
dark.</p>

<p class='c004'>A later, far higher phase of the law of sacrifice, is
that wherein no reward is thought of, or desired.
Reaching manhood, humanity grapples with the
duties and accepts all the grave responsibilities of
an advanced evolutional stage. Duty becomes the
motor of action, self-mastery and love of one’s
fellows the very keynotes of man’s music. The
animal part of his nature becomes subordinate to
the higher self. The third great lesson of sacrifice
works within, the lesson, viz. to do right simply
because it is right, to give because giving is owed
by each to all, and not because giving will in any
shape be pleasing to or rewarded by God.</p>

<p class='c004'>During the various stages of progress, the pain
aspect of sacrifice is clearly seen. Nevertheless, a
soul’s passionate grip upon things physical and
sensuous relaxes, and a day arrives when to give
spontaneously, freely, lavishly, is purest joy. Then
is man’s life merging into Divine life, and sacrifice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>is no more pain. Vital dissonances cease to rend
man’s heart, for his inner consciousness has soared
above the selfish separateness of phenomenal existence
into realms of nature where unity and love
are the all-prevailing principles of life. We know
these principles in action through the beautiful,
selfless earthly pilgrimage of Him we call the
Saviour of Mankind, whose whole career was an
At-one-ment with the Divine.</p>

<p class='c004'>The “Vicarious Atonement” doctrine of
Western faiths to-day is both an ecclesiastical
device for increasing priestly power and a misapprehension
of the law we have been considering—the
law of sacrifice, by which the worlds are made,
by which the worlds are living now, and by which
alone the union of man with God is brought about.
That noble doctrine of antiquity was changed by
Mediæval Christianity into a picture of the Godhead—Father
and Son, in opposition to one another—a
picture that “shocks all reverence, and outrages
reason by bringing all manner of legal quibbles into
the relationship between the Spirit of God and man.”
(<cite>Four Ancient Religions</cite>, Annie Besant, p. 166.)
Again, a race whose reasoning faculties are developed
must needs repudiate the Church’s dogma of
“Imputed Righteousness”—a righteousness not
inwrought or attained to, but applied externally—a
covering to what is corrupt and base, yet deemed
sufficient to secure a perfunctory pardon of sin, a
non-merited Divine favour.</p>

<p class='c004'>The real At-one-ment with the Divine, whereof
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>Jesus the Christ is our Archetype, admits of no
substitutions, no subterfuges, makes no fictitious
claims. It signifies an actual transformation or
process of change, the inner consciousness passing
from the lower to function on higher levels of being.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is easy, however, to apprehend how the necessity
of thinking of all supra-physical things, i.e. the
finer phenomena of existence, by means of analogies
and figures of speech that are purely physical, led
to much of error in the earlier stages of human
development; and there is a sense in which the
“robe of righteousness” is a not inapt analogy
or figure. When speaking of the pilgrimage of the
soul, the picture presented is that of a concrete
toiler, ascending slowly, breathing heavily, sighing
and evidencing effort to all our outer senses, yet we
know that the soul’s best efforts are mostly hidden
from sight and hearing and touch. But no confusion
arises. The mental conception to which the
figure points is that of efforts as great though
directed to evils that are chiefly mental, emotional,
moral, not physical. Similarly, the “robe of righteousness”
figure must not be overstrained. Man’s
soul is clothed upon by, or clothes itself in (it matters
not which, we say) robes or garments of flesh, and
of finer physical elements than flesh, elements intangible
to his five senses. The flesh garment or
body is constantly changing, and so are the bodies
of desire and of thought. The changes occur
through the action and interplay of diverse subtle
forces. Fresh elemental matter is borne in from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>without to replace the atoms of structures tending
to decompose, while a process of selection, determination
and assimilation proceeds through the
action of forces within.</p>

<p class='c004'>But the same laws of growth apply to realms of
nature less open to observation, and a careful selection
and choice of material is as potent and necessary
in building the bodies of desire and thought as in
building the body of solid flesh. And what are the
available materials here? In the hidden life of our
own thought and feeling we are conscious of an
unceasing flow of transient states, or we may express
it, currents of emotional and mental vibrations
reaching us from we know not whence, waves
breaking upon us from without. If we deliberately
choose the elevated moods, the purest, swiftest
vibrations, and seek habitually to retain these and
make them our own, sweetness and light must
inevitably characterize the habitation we are slowly
building for our inner consciousness. In other
words, the vehicles of our feeling and thought will
become as “robes of righteousness.”</p>

<p class='c004'>Desires, passions, emotions form what has been
called the astral body;<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c015'><sup>[17]</sup></a> aspiration and thought
or the action of reason, imagination and the artistic
faculties, create a still subtler, or mind-body, while
the blend of the two is what we are accustomed to
observe as ruling character. And when the physical
is cast off at death, man’s consciousness passes into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>his subtle bodies and into regions of bliss whither
we may not follow, but of which St. Paul gives us a
glimpse when he says “we have a building of God,
a house not made with hands, Eternal in the
Heavens.”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f17'>
<p class='c004'><a href='#r17'>17</a>. A real body of subtle matter interpenetrating the flesh
body and visible to some clairvoyants.</p>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Now, to minds permeated by cruder ideas of
man’s body and soul the above will seem mystical
and unreal. Nevertheless, there are many minds,
scientifically trained to a close observation of the
manifold phenomena of life with all the finer forces
and elements in nature, that are ready to accept a
truer conception of the complex constitution of man.
To all such, the proof of the actual existence of these
transcendental vehicles of consciousness lies in
hypnotic and other psychic phenomena, and in the
evidence of experience. For, given a certain amount
of intimate intercourse, and the man within the
man shows himself to the eye of his friend through
expression, attitude, gesture. But what the mental
eye sees behind the veil of flesh must exist in some
form. Hence the eye discerns not the consciousness,
but its phenomenal garment or vehicle, and
the texture organized is coarse, brutal, degraded or
animal, sensuous, selfish, or of a finer and purer
nature, divinely human, indicating the grade and
quality of the animating principle or soul within.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c007'>SUMMARY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Passing back once more from personal religion,
or the rise and purification of the inner nature of
the individual man, to the great subject of religion
in general, we must again have recourse to physical
analogies or figures of speech. A mighty stream or
current of spiritual vibrations has flowed from the
beginning behind the circumstances of history; and
each branch of the human family has caught up,
retained, and manifested a portion thereof. But
the manifestations have at all times been governed
by the receptive capacity of the particular race and
its inherent distinctions. Every formulated religion
is of dual complexion: first, the initial motive,
which is spiritual; second, the expression, which
is due to ideas, and these are furnished by the
mind. The creeds, dogmas, rituals, are outgrowths
of the age, civilization and locality.</p>

<p class='c004'>Christianity has ostensibly been the religion of
Western Europe during a long period of development
in all the material appliances of a civilized life
when mental and physical forces, engaged in accumulating
wealth, have dominated this development
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>and tended to depress and destroy the higher impulses
and aspirations of man. Christianity, already
weakened by errors that had crept in, was
unable to withstand the corrupting influences of
a money-making age. It adapted itself to the
sternly practical business-like son of the West, and
dropped out much of the imaginative and reflective
side of its teaching. But the “old order changeth,”
and, as has been shown in previous chapters, one
great department of civilized life, viz. the prevailing
system of industry, is hastening to its dissolution.
That system has been tried in the furnace of a longsuffering,
patient experience, and found to create
national wealth in abundance, while utterly failing
to subserve general well-being, and bring about a
just arrangement of social conditions.</p>

<p class='c004'>Through all the channels of the nation’s best
thinking there has sounded low, but clear as a
clarion note, a call to social reform, and now, in the
depths of industrial confusion, amid dumb despair
and loud-voiced public discontent, the still small
voice of conscience speaks audibly, and a stirring of
dry bones over the whole field of action, betokens
the awakening to a new era of existence. Spiritual
vibrations have loosened the foundations of our
materialized, selfish life, and pierced through the
crust of callous indifference to the heart of the nation.
A new tenderness lurks there. It prompts to the
entire overthrow of our hideous industrial warfare
and the substitution of a well-ordered system based,
reared and maintained through the action of wide-reaching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>love. But love was the distinguishing
feature of early Christianity, and the genius of its
teaching. Through the figure of family life, with its
tender ties, unselfish actions and unity of interests
and feeling, did Christianity strive to allure to the
broader, higher, deeper love that embraces all mankind
and manifests throughout all human relations.</p>

<p class='c004'>Pioneers of the social revolution may abjure the
churches, creeds and rituals, and boast themselves
agnostic, but none the less are they aiding the reembodiment,
on this material plane, of the true
religious spirit, or the birth of a religion fitted for
the nation’s age and civilization.<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c015'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f18'>
<p class='c004'><a href='#r18'>18</a>. Mr. Lester F. Ward (in his new work published in 1903)
formulates a distinction between human and animal
societies by saying that the environment transforms the
animal while man transforms the environment. This
transformation constitutes what he calls “achievement,”
and is the characteristic feature in human progress. The
products of “achievement” are not material things. They
are methods, ways, principles, devices, arts, systems,
institutions.</p>
</div>

<p class='c004'>The Church, it is true, gives no formal countenance
to the industrial revolution, but that does not disprove
my contention that it is the <em>distinctive religious
movement of this age</em>, and that it is in line and
harmony with the religious movements of former
ages. These may seem to have been less secular
than this, but they always embraced a reformation
of social and individual life. The actual distinction
arises from the Church’s own deficiencies, and from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>the greater elaboration of modern society, causing
an almost undue prominence to be given to the
outward changes necessary at the beginning of a
modern reformation. The Church must inevitably
conform itself to the industrial revolution. It
must reform itself from within; and this is clearly
perceived by many of its members.</p>

<p class='c004'>Whilst I write a conference of the Young Men’s
Christian Association is taking place. A question
discussed was: “What is the cause of young men’s
drifting away from the Church?” One speaker
remarked that to his mind the cause was the want
of fixity of opinion on the great fundamentals of
their common Christianity. Young men found
that ministers were not agreed upon what they
preached, and until the Church made up its mind
as to what was really the truth, there could be no
remedy for this drifting. Another speaker said he
knew young men who hated the Church, and said it
was not consistent. They pointed to the slum
dwellings in their great cities, and asked what the
Church was doing to remedy the state of affairs
there disclosed. In fact, they said: “Salvation
is hardly worth the taking, it’s so mixed up with
money-making. If the Church was to reach young
men, it must take up a more consistent attitude
with regard to all social questions.” (From the
<cite>Scotsman</cite>.)</p>

<p class='c004'>But religion is not of the Church alone, religion
appertains to the <em>totality</em> of life; and the right ordering
of all the conditions of the nation’s material
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>existence is the first step in the attainment of a
national religious life. For, observe, the broad
current of spiritual vibrations encompassing the
race can have no free course and ingress to thrill
the nerves and quicken the pulse of the nation so
long as there endures a fierce, brutal struggle for the
means of potential life—a struggle that hardens the
heart and coarsens the fibre of rich and poor alike.
The movement we call Economic Socialism is a
veritable recurrence of the cry of the Prophet
Esaias: “Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make
His paths straight.”<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c015'><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004'>The Church militant must adjust itself without

  <h2 class='c007'>SYNOPSIS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The world has a purpose.... That purpose aims not at
man as an end, but works through him to greater issues.—<span class='sc'>H.
G. Wells.</span></p>

<p class='c018'>Man has already furthered evolution very considerably,
half unconsciously and for his own personal advantage,
but he has not yet risen to the conviction that it is his
religious duty to do so deliberately and systematically.—<span class='sc'>Francis
Galton.</span></p>

<p class='c008'>More than a century has elapsed since Pope’s line
was written: “The proper study of mankind is
man,” yet it is only of recent years that physiology
has entered upon the proper method of that study.
Discoveries made in the last century have thrown
fresh light on individual human nature. The marvellous
potency of thought has been demonstrated,
and the momentous fact of diverse states of basic
consciousness made apparent—the fact, namely,
that the mind of individual man is not functionally
limited to his physical consciousness.</p>

<p class='c004'>Again, that every human being should have freedom
to be happy was realized by many at an earlier
epoch; but what the essential nature might be of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>a happiness that could satisfy the conflicting desires
of humanity differentiated in all its units—seemed
an insoluble problem. Psychology, however, indicates
the solution of that problem, for it shows that
individual happiness is intimately bound up with,
and dependent upon, <em>general happiness</em>. The “subliminal
or unconscious mind,” otherwise termed the
super-physical consciousness that is common to all
mankind knows no settled peace and comfort while
the areas of physically conscious life are scenes
of perpetual conflict. Man to be truly happy must
be so collectively and not merely individually or
sectionally.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now the scheme of social reform I advocate points
the way to a unification of thought that working
itself out through the diverse channels of visible
life will eject the causes of evil, bring order where
chaos has reigned, and slowly but surely establish
the foundations of universal peace. As Richard
Harte has well said: “Human beings at present
are like a number of little magnets thrown promiscuously
into a heap, with their poles pointing in
every direction, and wasting their strength in
opposing each other. These little magnets have
to point in the same direction that they may
become bound together into one great magnet, all
powerful to attract good, all powerful to repel
evil.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The new system of action bases its thought on the
complexity of human nature. It recognizes that
the component cells of the physical body are lives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>which must suffer if the laws of their well-being are
not subserved, and the suffering translates itself
into pain or into sub-conscious distressful melancholy.
It perceives that the social instincts of man
hitherto thrust back and crushed are: “the various
needs of universal attraction all tending towards
unity, striving to meet and mingle in final harmony”
(Zola). And further it apprehends that a lofty
aspiration—a divine impulse—hovers on the threshold
of consciousness waiting to enter as brutal
passions and vicious propensities are conquered and
dispossessed.</p>

<p class='c004'>The evils that infest and corrupt our social life
and that man must deliberately uproot and eliminate
before general happiness becomes possible are—poverty,
i.e. a life-long struggle to obtain food,
shelter, clothing; the birth of individuals weak and
unfit; disease, premature death; enforced celibacy;
late marriage; drunkenness; disorganization of
family life; prostitution; war; and industrial competition;
social injustice and inequality; individual
tyranny; crime; barbarous treatment of criminals;
disrespect of natural function and consequent injury
to health; conventional folly; social repression of
innocent enjoyment; religious bigotry; the feebleness
of religious guidance and confusion of religious
thought.</p>

<p class='c004'>Partial views of society as well as of individual
human nature have hitherto prevailed and given
birth to specifics of all kinds for the cure of the
diseases of society, and these in the growing tenderness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>of humanity, have been eagerly adopted and
applied, to prove disappointing in the main. The
new system deals with society as a whole and throughout
all its parts. It requires a full comprehension of
each and all the groups or classes of social phenomena
and their inter-relations.</p>

<p class='c004'>Viewing society as a whole, we realize that there
are no remedial specifics in the case, that general
happiness will be obtained only by a process of
evolution, and that the process is one of continual
readjustment of multitudinous relations, or unceasing
adaptation of individual human life to a
social environment, and of social environment to
individual human life. The evolution of social
environment proceeds towards the highest ethical
state which implies a system of society based upon
justice and equality. But the realization of this
state requires a perfected humanity, hence the path
of progress is also in the gradual improvement of
individuals—the creation of a superior race whose
spontaneous impulses will construct and support
a perfected social system.</p>

<p class='c004'>Unconscious evolution has carried us forward
from savagery through many transitions to a state
of civilization which, though grossly imperfect,
contains within it a new element of advance. Here
and there throughout society the power of love and
reason combined has become strong, and aided by a
scientific knowledge of man and the conditions of his
life, it is capable of design, and of intensifying the
action of evolutionary forces and immensely increasing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>their momentum. Reason, however, must
invent an effective policy of meliorism which so
unites the practical methods of reform as that each
will add strength to all, and the result prove a
powerful factor of change in the society on which it
is brought to bear.</p>

<p class='c004'>The strife of competition throughout the whole
sphere of industrial life gives free play to selfishness
and the passion of militancy, and permeates society
with the warlike spirit.</p>

<p class='c004'>Advance in morals is the sure step to a better
and happier future; but man’s moral nature is
largely conditioned by heredity, training and environment,
while these, at present, are all unfavourable
to a high moral state. A progressive system
of general reform therefore has to embrace and
combine rational breeding, rational training and a
rational order of life in which sympathy and co-operation
will take the place of individual competition,
and general happiness—not wealth—be the
clear aim of man.</p>

<p class='c004'>The conscious element in evolution is as yet too
weak to alter society much or rapidly, but in all
civilized countries—Germany, France, Belgium, etc.,
as well as Great Britain,—changes towards the collective
control of land and capital and the reorganization
of industry on collectivist principles, have
begun, and it is of supreme importance that other
changes, equally necessary, should be initiated to
advance <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">pari-passu</span></i> with those.</p>

<p class='c004'>A central source of corruption is to be found in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>the disintegration of the ancient family group—the
unfitness of an archaic domestic system to
achieve the ends of rational training and the acquiring
of habits of rational breeding. At the same
time there is a growth in social feeling and a spread
of public opinion in favour of industrial socialism
with some legislative and local action to carry it
out, that together, present conditions propitious
to change in domestic living and sexual custom.
Consequently a reconstruction of domestic life
on modern principles among educated people fitted
to adapt life to moral ends is pre-eminently a feature
of the new order.</p>

<p class='c004'>At present excessive labour on the part of the
proletariat, and enforced idleness on the part of
many men and women within the classes, are fatal
to progress. Vital forces are exhausted on the one
hand, repressed on the other, while the sub-conscious
feeling that craves unity and solidarity is
outraged and restrained. To restore <em>work</em> to its
legitimate place in human life is a primary aim of the
new domestic system. That system must be built
up on the principle that work for the benefit of all
is the duty and privilege of each, and without a due
share of social labour no normal man or woman in
health can attain to inward peace.</p>

<p class='c004'>As regards religion, man’s abstract thought must
purge itself from materialized ideals, his concrete
thought from selfish aims, for he is essentially a
religious being and psychical studies affirm that
within him there lie latent faculties that relate him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>to worlds unseen—worlds as yet unrealizable in
human consciousness.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the visible world religious forces must be
directed to the great work of social reform. To
unselfishly promote the welfare of generations unborn
is a profoundly religious course of action.
The purest, noblest feelings of man may be enlisted
in the cause of progress through union—for social
reconstruction, scientific education, gentle training
of the young, associated domestic life, facilitation
of happy marriage—and for the comfort of all mankind,
whether good or bad, clever or dull, fortunate
or unfortunate.</p>

<p class='c004'>Co-operation in work to the banishment of idleness
and its accompanying misery <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</span></i> is the primary
object of the new domestic system, but other ends
to attain are—economy, by means of joint labour
and joint expense to the relief of monetary anxieties
and domestic worries; stability of social position,
i.e. no member needing to fear that his home will
break up independently of his wishes; social intercourse
and enjoyment relieved of conventional
etiquette or tyranny; freedom for friendship between
the sexes and such conditions of family union
as will promote mental capacity and altruistic sentiment
in each individual; early marriage without
disregard of social responsibility and based upon
mutual knowledge of character, habits and tastes;
a fitting refuge for old age, rendering impossible the
premature destruction of valuable social forces
which age alone can supply, and securing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>material, intellectual and emotional surroundings
necessary for comfort up to the last moment of
life.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the lower social strata where any reconstruction
of family life is not yet possible, what is immediately
required is a gradual rise of wages with
steady improvement in all the conditions of industrial
labour. Society also must relinquish such
patronage of the poor as fosters their too rapid
increase, undermines their self-dependence and
tends generally to deterioration of race. Parental
responsibility must be strongly inculcated and
strictly upheld. Public teaching should be given
in all natural laws affecting society, especially the
laws of health, increase, and heredity; and, under
conditions respectful to human dignity, Malthusian
doctrine should be taught, and a knowledge of
neo-Malthusian method very carefully imparted.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the higher social strata within the newly constructed
modern homes sexual conduct and parentage
with its far-reaching results for good or evil must
be controlled or guided into the path of racial
regeneration. The scientific study of man’s nature
gives sexual passion an honourable position relatively
to human life. It rests on the conscience of each
adult generation as an imperative social duty
to influence the young generation in such wise as
that this great passion shall subserve physical and
social health and cease to create degradation.</p>

<p class='c004'>A due activity in growing organs strengthens
organic function; therefore, with early marriages
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>and freedom to young love, checked only by scientific
knowledge of the laws of health, propagation at the
age of maturity is bound to put forth vitality of
good quality. In conscious evolution sexual functions
are no longer regarded as essentially allied
with propagation. They are regarded, however,
as properly subject in youth to parental and social
control; and that control acts as a perpetual restraint
upon licentious, dissolute tendencies and a
shield to the young love that seeks personal happiness
consistent with domestic purity.</p>

<p class='c004'>No less potent is the action of control in another
direction. Physiology of sex and the laws of
inheritance are carefully studied by guardians
of domestic peace who, rejecting the ordinary and
vulgar conception accept the teaching of science,
and science points to philoprogenitiveness, or love
of offspring, as the proper motor force in reproduction.
Were this force the antecedent cause of
parentage throughout the nation, disease and premature
death would be undermined and gradually
subside. “Indiscriminate survival” gives way
before that “rational selection and birth of the fit”
which is a fundamental condition of social well-being—the
master-spring to a rapid evolution of
general happiness.</p>

<p class='c004'>The transition, however, from our present state
of confused sentiment, illogical thought, and disastrous
action in the field of <em>eugenics</em> or stirpiculture,
to clearness of purpose and consistency of life, must
necessarily be a work of extreme delicacy and patient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>endeavour. Its achievement requires the nuclei of
collectivist homes. Its nurture must take place
in the bosom of a superior domestic life. The process,
in short, implies an alteration in humanity
itself, to be brought about by such preparatory
alteration in outward conditions as will set up and
bring into play the constant interaction of new social
forces.</p>

<p class='c004'>Individualism in domestic life vitiates the movement
towards socialism outside domestic life, for
it gives us misshapen units unfit for a better social
system—a system that seeks to banish tyranny,
despotism, pride, self-will and every anti-social
emotion in order to establish the perfect justice
and equality that are essential to the highest ethical
state. It is a necessity of socialism to lay hold of
the family and fashion it anew so that it may produce
a superior material of human life, i.e. individual
men and women whose enjoyments lie chiefly
in sympathy and whose spontaneous impulses are
towards an essentially social life.</p>

<p class='c004'>And further, not only is our present domestic
system wholly incapable of dealing with sex relations
so as to adapt them to stirpiculture, not only is it
so feeble as to be absolutely impotent in the regulation
of the conduct of masculine youth outside its
boundaries, but it is destitute also of elements
required in the organizing of a progressive educational
system.</p>

<p class='c004'>Home education has almost disappeared in the
disintegration of family life, while in society the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>strong forces of aggregation which under diverse
conditions of industry and convention group mankind
in sections have moulded schools to massive
proportions. The youth of the nation is in a great
measure cut off from the home influences which are
calculated to teach mankind “humanities, not in
the academic but in the real sense.” It is congregated
in universities and large schools for superior
culture and day schools for culture of a less exalted
order. In the former, young men and maidens are
separated. Domesticity—the quality in human
nature on which depends the consolidation of
society, is disregarded, whilst to the development
of mutual interests, affinity of tastes, harmony of
habits and unanimity of social aims between the
sexes no attention is paid during the plastic period
of life when individual character is in process of
determination. In day schools boys and girls are
often associated, but under such conditions of
mechanical routine, cramming, conflicting and
alternating authorities, irregular and erratic forces
of moral control, as to make these schools provocative
of evil, fostering every anti-social instinct
of man.</p>

<p class='c004'>Co-ordination in the life of the young is the demand
of the new system of general reform. The nursery,
school and playground must be harmonized, and
the entire juvenile orbit, within and without the
home, governed by intellectual and moral forces
of fixed congruity. The object and aim of true
education is the fullest development of an individual’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>best powers of thought, feeling, action,
by means of their happy exercise at every stage of
growth from childhood to maturity. Now book-learning
or culture in schools accomplishes very
little, but a direct study of nature is an incomparable
aid to this end. Each object and process in nature
from that of the infinitely great to the infinitely
small—if fittingly dealt with by teachers—is instinct
with charm for the young of an intelligent
race. It excites imagination, awakens thought,
kindles enthusiasm, stimulates every latent mental
faculty, while the endless variation of beauty in
nature—under training to close observation—makes
aesthetic appeal to the sense perceptions, and in calling
forth wonder, admiration, delight adds richness
immeasurably to the quality of human life. Nevertheless
the springs and checks of a true education
lie deep in a world of feeling. For their exercise
home-life is indispensable. Family love is the
primary motor force in the education of the feelings,
and without the presence of a wide domestic circle
habitually fostering the sympathetic and repressing
the selfish emotions no high water-mark of civilization
will be reached.</p>

<p class='c004'>There is in man a group of emotions of comparatively
recent origin requiring scientific treatment
of the utmost delicacy and precision. On the
further development of that group depends in a
very special manner the rapid evolution of an ethical
social system. The group is threefold—egoistic,
altruistic, moral. It comprises a sense of personal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>rights, a sympathetic jealousy for the rights of
others, an intellectual and moral sentiment of
justice, or equivalence of liberty and social comfort
for all mankind. The first element is already very
perceptible throughout society. The second is more
rare; it must be strengthened or assiduously created
in the nursery, schoolroom and domestic circle
by a system of training whose characteristic is
extreme gentleness. The tender shoots of sympathetic
jealousy are incapable of growth in an
environment of harsh sound or brutal force. Hence
the authority that begets antagonism has no place
in the perfected education of the future.</p>

<p class='c004'>As the young emerge from childhood the responsibilities
of life become aids in education, and immensely
develop the above emotions. Discipline
of conduct within their own order appertains to the
young; whilst society, within and without the
domestic circle, demands the thorough regulation
of young life. Conduct clubs and combinations
for a variety of social ends, both sexes taking part,
arise among the young; and these promote in the
highest degree the healthy growth of such virtuous
emotion and habits in the individual as are indispensable
to ethical socialism. The method adopted
is a just and intelligent criticism to which the youthful
mind has previously been trained.</p>

<p class='c004'>Since pride of birth, pride of wealth and habits
of domination and luxury are all unfavourable to
the growth of a moral sentiment of social justice,
it is not in the upper ranks of society we need look
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>for the public spirit that will devise methods of
gradually equalizing the labour of life and its rewards
and undermining present class distinctions. As
little likely is the sentiment of social justice to spring
spontaneously in a fortunate capitalist class where
pride of acquisition strongly opposes the principle
that reward should not be proportioned to personal
capacity—that mental labour has no title to
inordinate distinction, but that other useful exertion
ethically requires fullness of reward. Reconstruction
is necessarily a growth from below. From the
proletariat comes the impulse towards industrial
reconstruction, and it is in the middle class—and the
less wealthy section of that class—that the beings
exist who by segregation may form collectivist
homes capable of by-and-bye aggregating into the
solid foundation of a pure and elevated republican
society.</p>

<p class='c004'>Education in these homes where mixture of ages,
from the white-haired centenarian to the infant in
arms, creates all manner of tender ties, where gentleness
and love are the main stimuli in training, where
authority is exercised consistently and reasonably,
and replaced at maturity by reason and self-control—must
eventuate in the production of a superior
moral and intellectual type.</p>

<p class='c004'>The order of social evolution, computed roughly,
is as follows: In the first stage, social equality
exists; it is an epoch of savagery. In the second
stage, differentiation issuing in class distinctions
takes place; the birth of social inequality and injustice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>arising naturally through exercise of superior
brute force and cunning. Civilization has here its
genesis; and coercion, tyranny, robbery, injustice,
avarice, love of power, inequality, are stimuli of
civilization and prime elements in the formation of
strong nations. Individuals who are inferior, then
whole classes socially weak, are compelled by forces,
individual and social, to minister to the wants of
the strong and superior. Civilization nurtured by
inequality and injustice develops in the superior
classes of society and slowly spreads downwards.
In the third stage, reaction occurs, prompted by
civilization itself! Justice and liberty develop
in the lower or inferior social classes and spread very
slowly upwards without destroying a civilization,
become inherent in the superior type of man. The
fourth stage is one of readjustment in which civilization
becomes general and there is a gradual return
to social equality. Ultimately society will have no
class distinctions of the present order, no idlers
or parasites, no poor and no coercive government.
Voluntary co-operation or concerted action for
social ends is a self-regulating, self-controlling force
which, when fully developed in the new domestic
and industrial systems is able to dominate society
throughout its length and breadth.</p>

<p class='c004'>The path of social reform I advocate has now,
in its main features, been placed before my readers.</p>

<p class='c004'>Outside the general policy that will cause the
direct action of the system to become a great factor
of social change, however, there are sundry courses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>of less direct action, it is bound to pursue. These
bear relation to, first, pauperism and patronage of
the poor; second, the proletariat; third, the criminal
classes; fourth, the position of woman; fifth,
the young; sixth, conventionalism; seventh,
political action.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the first relation the specific policy is to carefully
discriminate between benevolence that is
beneficial and benevolence that is mischievous in its
results on social well-being. Whilst exercising the
former, it gives no support to charities that hurt
the independence of the poor, or relieve them of
parental responsibility. In reproduction it discountenances
and opposes the social force of <em>indiscriminate
selection</em> which results in survival of the
unfit. It seeks to initiate and press forward the
counteracting social force of <em>intelligent selection</em>,
which brings about the birth of the fit.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the second relation, the specific policy
strenuously supports combinations of workers
for the raising of wages, mutual help and democratic
political aims preparatory to general
socialism.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the third relation, the specific policy strives to
enlighten public opinion upon the nature of crime
and the philosophic principles of its treatment.
It elaborates a new method in which vindictiveness,
the essence of punishment, has no existence; but
gentleness towards all evil-doers issues in, first, the
effectual protection of society; second, the reform
of corrigible criminals; third, the gradual extinction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>of crime. It urges upon government a cautious
deliberate adoption of this method.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the fourth relation, the action of the policy
is to promote the enfranchisement of women, and
at every point aid the movement of advance to the
position of social equality of sex.</p>

<p class='c004'>In the fifth and sixth relations, it inculcates by admonition
and example, and especially among the
young, a return to simplicity of manners, habits
and dress. It repudiates conventional etiquette,
and opposes the tyranny of fashion. It promotes
the association of the sexes in youth under condition
of adult control, whether the union be that of
marriage, of friendship or of simple intercourse
and companionship. It discountenances and takes
no part in the excitements of an artificial, frivolous
society, but it creates and fosters the vigorating
excitements of useful labour, alternating with unconstrained
and “tranquil delights.”</p>

<p class='c004'>In the seventh relation, the specific policy agitates
for alteration of the marriage laws, the laws of
inheritance of property and the land laws. Equality
of sex is required as the basis of the marriage law,
accompanied by the condition of easy divorce in
order to facilitate the dissolution of false ties in
favour of the true. The laws affecting children
require adaptation to the ethics of social justice
and sex equality. Laxity must give way to strictness
in respect of parentage; and child-birth be
recognized as an event bearing directly upon the
interests of the general public. Hence modification
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>here entails the recognition of illegitimate children
and the counteracting of the vicious tendency to
shirk parental duty and social responsibility. The
land and property laws must be adjusted to a
levelling process—the action of paring down large
estates and diminishing the massive proportions
of private property so slowly as to create no individual
suffering or social confusion, such legislative
measures being directed, however, to land nationalization
and nationalization of capital as their final
aim.</p>

<p class='c004'>In conclusion, let me add, I claim to have shown
that “science in the economic field gives certain
facts from which a line of social evolution may be
foreshadowed,” and that religion and science give,
in wider fields, facts and principles that point to lines
of illimitable progression for man. “Whether these
lines will be followed depends not upon immutable
laws beyond our control, but upon the <em>human will</em>.”
The general policy I advocate is distinctly reliable
so long as it rests on scientific methods and knowledge,
but no question is finally exhausted. In the
sphere of rational reform free-thought must ever
be considered and respected.</p>
